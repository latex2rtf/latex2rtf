Sun has decided to support the XPG4 standard on Solaris by an
alternative set of binaries.  So to get make check to work, 

	1) change the first line of latex2png to 

		#!/usr/xpg4/bin/sh  
	
	2) define the XPG4_GREP environment variable accordingly,
	for bash-like shells

		XPG4_GREP=/usr/xpg4/bin/grep; export XPG4_GREP

	for tsch-like shells
	 
		setenv XPG4_GREP /usr/xpg4/bin/grep
