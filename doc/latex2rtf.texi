In 1994 the first Version of LaTeX2rtf was written by a group of students of
the Viena University supervised by Ralf Schlatterbeck. They took up a LaTeX
parser and added most of the functionality to the program. In 1995 work
continued with a second group of students. The result was LaTeX2rtf Version
1.5.
In 1998 Georg Lehner jorge_lehner@@gmx.net found the reference to LaTeX2rtf on
the Textconversion webpage http://www.fz-juelich.de/isr/1/texconv.htm of
Wilfried Hennings W.Hennings@@fz-juelich.de, added some functionality and took
over the maintainence of the program. Wilfried Hennings actually coordinates
the development of the program and maintains the project on sourceforge http://
sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/ where there are also
mailing lists for users
latex2rtf-users@@lists.sourceforge.net
and developers
latex2rtf-developers@@lists.sourceforge.net.
For subscription to these lists:
mail_to_latex2rtf-users-request@@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe
or
mail_to_latex2rtf-developers-request@@lists.sourceforge.net?subject=subscribe
Meanwhile, Version 1.9d is available, with a couple of bug-fixes and some
enhancements for several document-classes/styles.
Afterwards there shall be a jump to Version 2.0 with a complete redesign, but
this is not history but future ...

@node Introduction, Availability, History, Top
@chapter  Introduction

LaTeX2rtf is a translator program from LaTeX text into the RTF format which is
native to Microsoft Word and Word for Windows. RTF can be exported and/or
imported by several textprocessors.
The text and much of the formatting information is translated to RTF, making
the new file look very similar to the original.
Now, for what do we need such a thing? There are three purposes:
  1.)
      You use LaTeX and hate everything beginning with MS-... But you have to
      send your documents to people which don't even now that there exist other
      things than MS-...
  2.)
      You know somebody who sends you frecuently very fine LaTeX-documents. But
      you are "on the other side" and need to import her files, steal some part
      of them and Desktop-publish it with your fine MS-... environment.
  3.)
      You maybe have both things, LaTeX and MS-..., or you don't. But you like
      the way how LaTeX and friends work, and you don't want to type in a
      letter to your friends with about 345 characters and end up with a `.doc'
      file of 32,845 Byte. So you edit your documents either with edit.com or
      edlin in the structured form that LaTeX encourages, and then you use
      MS-..., or MS-...-Viewer or any other rtf-rendering Software to print out
      your file.
Nevertheless there are drawbacks in the conversion. In fact, don't expect any
LaTeX-file to be converted like you want, don't expect it to be converted
without errors or warnings, and: don't even expect it to be converted at all,
since LaTeX2rtf is at most at a very experimental stage. LaTeX2rtf is known to
have a lot of bugs. And they grow more and more each day. In fact we could
state that there are some special cases, where a LaTeX-file can be translated
to RTF satisfactorily by LaTeX2rtf.
-- This was sort of disclaimer, ok? Ok!
LaTeX is a system for typesetting text and therefore it focuses on the logical
structure of a document, whilst RTF is meant to be a transport format for a
family of Desktop Publishing Software, dealing mostly with the design of a
text.
Although the posible different commands and styles in LaTeX are much more
delimited and better standardized than in RTF, only a small subset of them is
(yet) implemented. Look at See section Unimplemented_Features for more details.
Some of the capabilities are restricted or buggy, see also See section Known
Bugs.
RTF is a moving target, i.e. Microsoft(tm) does not stop to invent new
extensions and features for it. So you cannot view newer RTF files with older
Word Processors. LaTeX2rtf eventually will generate RTF-output that is
unreadable with your Programm.
Also the syntax and semantics are somewhat deliberate, i.e. you can generate a
syntactically correct RTF file that cannot be displayed by some Word
Processors.
For more details on RTF look at the RTF-Tools by Paul DuBois, and the
corresponding newsgroups, etc. http://www.primate.wisc.edu/

@chapter Availability

LaTeX2rtf is available for a lot of Unix Platforms, for Macintosh, and for MS-
DOS, including all versions of MS Windows 95.
The MSDOS version (1.8aa and up) will also run under all MS Windows versions.
It requires an i386 processor or better.
The Win32 Version requires Cygnus-Cygwin32 (See http://sources.redhat.com/
cygwin/). As the MSDOS version (1.8aa and up) will also run under all MS
windows versions, the Win32 version is discontinued.
You find the latest version on sourceforge http://sourceforge.net/projects/
latex2rtf/ and -- with some delay -- on CTAN sites: e.g. http://www.dante.de or
http://www.ctan.org.
There are a couple of persons working on the LaTeX2rtf-revival, coordinated by
Wilfried Hennings W.Hennings@@fz-juelich.de.

@chapter Invoking_LaTeX2rtf


The latex2rtf command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format. The text and
much of the formatting information is translated to RTF making the new file
look very similar to the original.
The command line syntax is:
latex2rtf [-V] [-l] [-v #] [-o outputfile] [-a auxfile] [-b bblfile] [-i idiom]
[inputfile]
See section Missing_and_Faulty_command_line_options for actual implementations
irregularities.
The `-V' option prints version information on standard output and exits.
The `-l' option enables you to convert ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) special characters
in the LaTeX source.
The `-i' option requires a language (idiom) as an option. The corresponding
`idiom.cfg' file is then used to translate the predefined section headings of
LaTeX to idiom.
The `-v' (verbosity) option determines the amount of information while
processing the inputfiles. `0' means only Errors, `1' Warning Messages
(default) also. See section Verbosity for more details.
Unless an outputfile is specified with the `-o' option, the resulting RTF is
produced on standard output.
You can specify an auxfile (for citations) with the `-a' option. If this is
omitted, the name of the inputfile with the suffix replaced `.aux' will be
taken.
The `.aux'-file is needed for cross-references and citations. You have to
provide both, the `.tex'- and the `.aux'-file to be able to convert LaTeX-files
with this features.
You can specify a bblfile (for citations) with the `-b' option. If this is
omitted, the name of the inputfile with the suffix replaced by `.bbl' will be
taken.
If inputfile is not specified, standard input is read.
User defined LaTeX commands are ignored. If you are familiar with the RTF
format and the commands can be translated by simply inserting a format string
into the RTF file you can add these commands to the direct.cfg configuration
file. See section `direct.cfg' for a format description.
To correctly convert font names you must edit the fonts.cfg configuration file.
You have to specify the font names you use and how the LaTeX default font names
should be converted to RTF. See format description inf section `fonts.cfg'.
LaTeX variables and user defined commands are not evaluated. They will be
simply ignored. To let latex2rtf know the names of variables you can add them
in the ignore.cfg file. See section `ignore.cfg' for a format description.
The language dependent sectioning names can be redefined to meet the idiom of
the LaTeX document. See See section `language.cfg' for a description.
The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the support
files (all files ending in .cfg). If no file is found during the search in the
search-path or if the environment variable is not set, the compiled-in default
for the configuration-file directory is used. If the files are not found at all
the program aborts.
In the MS-DOS version the search path is separated by `;' in the Unix version
by `:'. For the paths themselves apply `\' and `/'. A separator may appear at
the beginning or ending of RTFPATH.
CAUTION: Please make sure that the input file is a correct LaTeX file. Use
LaTeX to find and correct errors before using latex2rtf. The conversion command
does not properly handle all errors caused by corrupt input files.
Make sure that the configuration files are in the correct directory. LaTeX2rtf
will need at least `fonts.cfg', `direct.cfg', `ignore.cfg', `english.cfg'.
You may have to change one ore more of them to suit your needs, see section
Configuring_LaTeX2rtf for details.
See See section Reporting_Bugs on how to reach the maintainer.

With the `-v' option you can specify how much of its internal working LaTeX2rtf
is reporting.
If there is a logfile specified the output goes to this file. Nonetheless
Warnings and Errors are logged to stderr always.
(Actually) possible values of `-v' are
  `0'

@node Isolatin, Languages, Verbosity, Invoking_LaTeX2rtf
@section Isolatin

It is not necesary to specify the -l option if you use \usepackage@{isolatin1@}
or \documentstyle[isolatin1]@{...@}. LaTeX2rtf automagically detects this
packages/style options and switches to processing of ISO-Latin1 codes.

@node Languages,  , Isolatin, Invoking_LaTeX2rtf
@section Languages

Do not append the `.cfg' suffix to the idiom parameter to -i switch. If you
specify an idiom that does not exist in the search path for configuration files
as described above the program aborts.
In the actual version there are four language files delivered: english, french,
german, spanish. If you specify \usepackage or a documentstyle option with one
of these idioms LaTeX2rtf automagically loads the correct language file and you
can omit the -i switch.
See See section `language.cfg' for details on how to write a `idiom.cfg' file
for your language by yourself.

@section Support for the Hyperlatex Style

Otfried Schwarzkopf has created the "Hyperlatex Markup Language" which is a
"little package that allows you to use LaTeX to prepare documents in HTML."\/.
It brings an Emacs lisp program with it to convert the Hyperlatex file to HTML.
Hyperlatex can be obtained from the CTAN-sites, see section Availability.
There are two handsome commands that avoid typing: \link and \xlink that
generate an "internal" label which then is used in the following \Ref and
\Pageref commands.
LaTeX makes it possible to write `\link@{anchor@}[ltx]@{label@}', which typesets:
`anchor ltx'. LaTeX2rtf does NOT support this aproach since the optional
parameter is thrown away by now, see section LaTeX2rtf_under_Development for
details.
Note that you have to update your `.cfg' files if you are upgrading, since
there are a lot of HTML oriented commands in Hyperlatex that we simply can
`ignore'.

@node LaTeX2e, Character encoding, Support for the Hyperlatex Style, Features
@section LaTeX2e

LaTeX2rtf understands \documentclass@{...@} and \usepackage@{...@}, but the
optional parameter of the latter is thrown away. See See section Known_Bugs.

@node Character encoding, Cross References, LaTeX2e, Features
@section Character encoding

If using the -l command line option or the isolatin1 package or style,
LaTeX2rtf automagically interprets the contents of the input file as ISO_8859_1
encoded and generates the corresponding RTF tokens on output.
In some situations this conversion does not take place, or is faulty. See See
section Known_Bugs.
If you have another package that provides support for this or another codepage
please notify us (section Reporting_Bugs), to include support for it.

@node Cross References, Pagestyles, Character encoding, Features
@section Cross References

If RTF version 1.1 is chosen (see section Missing_and_Faulty_command_line
options) \label, \ref, and \pageref commands from LaTeX are translated to
hidden text in the RTF file. This makes it possible to correctly edit the
resulting file in the target word processor. If RTF version 1.4 (or higher) is
chosen, crossreference updating is automated by the RTF reader.

@node Pagestyles, Internationalization, Cross References, Features
@section Pagestyles

If there is no \pagestyle command, the RTF output is generated as with plain
pagestyle, i.e. each page get's its page number centered at the bottom.
You must turn this off with the \pagestyle@{empty@} command in the LaTeX file if
you don't want pagenumbers.
The headings and myheadings styles are silently ignored by now.
The twosided option to the \documentstyle or \documentclass produces the
corresponding RTF tokens.
Note that these features require RTF Version 1.4.

@node Internationalization,  , Pagestyles, Features
@section Internationalization

LaTeX2rtf translates automatically the sectioning titles for `Part',
`References', `Bibliography' and `Abstract' if it encounters a `german' or
`spanish' package or documentstyle option.
The other fixed sectioning titles ("Table of Contents" and the like) are not
yet needed, because LaTeX2rtf does not handle these LaTeX features.
See See section Missing_and_Faulty_command_line_options for information on
other languages.
Encountering the `german' package or documentstyle option (by H.Partl of the
Viena University) makes LaTeX2rtf behave like that: German Quotes, German
Umlauts by `"a', etc. ...

@section Input_processing 

On processing input LaTeX2rtf first converts the LaTeX special characters. If
it encounters one of the standard commands it is converted internally. If a
command is not known to LaTeX2rtf it is first looked up in the section
`direct.cfg' and the RTF code specified there is output. If not found there it
is looked up in the section `ignore.cfg', since there are a lot of LaTeX
commands that do not show up in the .dvi output (cross reference information
and the like), or that we are not able or willing to convert to rtf.
You can use `ignore.cfg' if you get bored to see "WARNING: command: foo not
found - ignored" and you don't need `foo' in your Word(R) document, but it
would be nice to send me the offending command to include it in the
distributions configuration files.
LaTeX2rtf accepts Unix-like, MSDOS and Macintosh line ending codes (\n, \r\n
and \r).
Optionally the input is interpreted as iso-latin1 encoded, section Character
encoding.

@node Output_formatting , `direct.cfg' , Input_processing , Configuring_LaTeX2rtf
@section Output_formatting 

Since the RTF-Readers normally have their own mood of typesetting and font
handling we have to convert the LaTeX fonts to RTF fontnames. This is handled
by the file section `fonts.cfg'.
If you have information about adequate font mappings from Metafont to TrueType
fonts please send me a note, so I can improve the resemblence beetween LaTeX
and RTF output. I would be happy to include a font resource list in this
manual.
Nevertheless you are free to make all fancy things you like, map \rm on
WingDings if you feel somewhat strange today...
The standard LaTeX styles have some fixed Title names like `Part', `Reference'
or `Bibliography' that appeared in English or German in the output with the
original versions of LaTeX2rtf.
Now you can determine what should appear at this places with an appropiate
section `language.cfg' file.
Actually I grep-ed the descriptions out of the `babel' files from teTeX to
supply english, german and spanish translations.
On writing output, LaTeX2rtf generates \n (lf, Newline) as line ending code.
Your RTF-Reader should accept this on any platform. If you ftp your RTf-file
from or to MSDOS platforms the line ending code can be converted to \r\n. As
this should also be legal to any RTf-Reader the resulting RTF-rendering should
not be affected.

@node `direct.cfg' , `ignore.cfg' , Output_formatting , Configuring_LaTeX2rtf
@section `direct.cfg' 

The file direct.cfg is used for converting LaTeX commands by simple text
replacement. The format consists of lines with a LaTeX command with backslash
followed by comma. The rest of the line until a '.' character will be written
to the RTF file when the command is recognized in the LaTeX file. Lines
starting with a '#' character are ignored. After the '.' everything is ignored
to end of line. To select a specific font use *fontname*. Make sure that the
font name fontname is listed in the fonts configuration file at least as dummy.
To write the '*' character use "**". example:
`\alpha,@{\f*Symbol* a@}. #alpha under Windows Symbol Font'
`\copyright,@{\ansi\'a9\pc@}.'

@node `ignore.cfg' , `fonts.cfg' , `direct.cfg' , Configuring_LaTeX2rtf
@section `ignore.cfg' 

The file ignore.cfg is used for defining how to ignore certain commands. This
file is used for recognition of LaTeX-variables, user defined variables, and
some simple commands. All variables are ignored but the converter must know the
names to correctly ignore assignments to variables. Lines in this file consist
of a variable-name with backslash, followed by comma and the type of the
variable followed by '.'. Possible Types are:
  NUMBER
       simple numeric value
  MEASURE
       numeric value with following unit of measure
  OTHER
       ignores anything to the first character after '=' and from there to next
      space. eg. \setbox\bak=\hbox
  COMMAND
       ignores anything to next '\' and from there to the occurence of anything
      but a letter. eg. \newbox\bak
  SINGLE
       ignore single command. eg. \noindent
  PARAMETER
       ignores a command with one paramter, eg. \foo@{bar@}
  PACKAGE
       does not produce a Warning message if PACKAGE is encountered, eg.
      `PACKAGE,kleenex.'
  ENVCMD
       proceses contents of unknown environment as if it were plain latex eg.
      `ENVCMD,iflatex.' treats: `\begin@{iflatex@} text \end@{iflatex@} ' as
      `text'.
  ENVIRONMENT
       ignores contents of that environment, eg. with `ENVIRONMENT,ifhtml.'
      `\begin@{ifhtml@} text \end@{ifhtml@} ' ignores `text'.
The types are in upper case exactly as above. Do not use spaces. Lines starting
with a '#' character are ignored. After the '.' everything is ignored to end of
line. Example:
`\pagelength,MEASURE.'

@node `fonts.cfg' , `language.cfg' , `ignore.cfg' , Configuring_LaTeX2rtf
@section `fonts.cfg' 

The file `fonts.cfg' contains the fonts conversion table. A line consists of a
font name in LaTeX followed by comma and a font name in RTF. The end is marked
by a '.'. No spaces are allowed. The LaTeX font will be converted to the RTF
font if encountered in the LaTeX file. If multi- ple translations for a LateX
font are specified, only the first is used. All fonts in a LaTeX file that are
not in this file will be mapped to the default font. All RTF fonts listed in
this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or not. Lines starting
with a '#' character are ignored. After the '.' everything is ignored to end of
line. To add a RTF font not used as substitute for a LaTeX font - for example a
Symbol font used in direct.cfg - use a dummy LaTeX name like in the following
example:
`Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.'
Make sure you use the correct font name. Take care of spaces in font names. The
default fonts are named Roman (command \rm), Slanted (command \sl), Sans Serif
(command \sf), Typewriter (command \tt).

@chapter Error Messages and Logging of LaTeX2rtf's Activity 

Note: Error reporting and logging is one of the most chaotic aspects of the
program. There are a lot of inconsistencies, but I hope to get it cleaner with
time.
As stated in section Verbosity LaTeX2rtf provides a means to control the amount
of information it put's out on stderr.
  Fatal error messages
      indicate a bug in the source code. PLEASE report them, if they do not
      apear in the documentation, see section Reporting_Bugs. Note: By now you
      won't be informed by the program if an error is fatal or not. Try to find
      it out by context ...
  Error messages
      always abort the program. They are thrown on conditions that do not allow
      further converting of the input file, but should be either documented as
      missing or unimplemented feature, or should be able to be corrected by
      the user (e.g. missing `.cfg' files).
  Warning messages
      inform you, that there is some conversion loss from LaTeX to RTF, or that
      the output file has some restrictions on some RTF Readers.
Error and Warning messages should follow the GNU Coding standards, i.e. they
have the format:
``inputfile':line: Error|Warning: message'
Note: Neither the inputfile may be correctly announced if `\input'ing it, nor
can you rely on the linenumber, see section Known_Bugs.
The other messages only indicate `filename' (sometimes wrong) and linenumber
(also sometimes wrong) and some more or less usefull or interesting message.
Don't try to encounter any sense in Verbosity levels above 3, these are for my
own delight only and can change significantly between versions.

      \markboth and \markright.
    * To include the tableofcontents there would be two approaches: Transfer
      sectioning information, title text and let produce pagenumber by the rtf-
      reader. Scan and label all of the sectioning commands while reading and
      then construct the sectioning information using these labels. Needs two
      passes on latex input.
    * Separate the Scope of the Document Environment from the Preample
      Environment.
    * Rewrite the parser to allow some kind of macro expansion hence more
      flexibility in configuration and extension.
    * newcounter, newenvironment, newcommand, ...
    * Include the GNU gettext package to internationalize LaTeX2rtf's Messages.
    * Switch over to GNU getopt() and long options.
Here comes a list of LaTeX-commands that are not implemented:
`setlength, bigcap, dag, ddag, sharp, clubsuit, sim, nobreak, vspace, today,
left-((, right-))'

@section Missing and Faulty command line options 

In this section you find comments about missing and buggy command line options.
  `-V'
       The Version information output is not compatible with the GNU Coding
      Standards.
  `-v'
       Information logging and Error reporting is not implemented consistently.
      So do expect confusing Messages and inconsistent format. The linenumber
      and filename of the offending spot in the input in the most cases is not
      correctly determined.
  `'
       There should be an option to intersperse RTF-Output with the LaTeX-input
      that produced it to have a better hand for debugging.
  `-o'
       Actually you must specify an output filename. Maybe further on the
      meaning of this option changes, as writing `-o filename' takes more
      typework then `> filename'. Either you may specify the name, or you must
      not do it, depending on wether we choose to use GNU getopt or not.
  `-l'
       There is only one coding scheme for the input file, ISO-Latin1.
  `-q'
       There should be a `-q' (quiet) option, to suppress Warning Messages. By
      now this can be achieved by the -v 0 option.
  `-rmajor.minor'
       There should be an option that restrict the generation of RTF code with
      version greater than major,minor. Actually this is done at compile time.
      There are some Warning messages if "newer" RTF Code is generated, but it
      is not consistent at all.
  `-h'
       The default values for search pathes and switches changeable by
      commandlineoptions should be shown.
There is a need for a `--language' option (`-l' is yet used, and could be
changed to -e # (--encoding). `-i' as for `--international' is chosen meanwhile
so that the user can select an alternate language file, see section Output
formatting.
It would be useful to implement the GNU long option names, e.g.: `--verbosity',
`--output_file', `--quiet', etc.

@section Known Bugs 

   1. The first parameter of a \link@{anchor@}[ltx]@{label@} is converted to the
      rtf-output. Label is stored to hyperref for later use, the optional
      parameter is ignored. [ltx] should be processed as Otfried recommends it,
      to use for exclusive latex output.e.g: \link@{readhere@}[~\Ref]@{explaining:
      chapter@}. Since @{explaining:chapter@} is yet read by latex and hyperlatex
      when [...] is evaluated it produces the correct reference. LaTeX2rtf is
      only strolling from left to right through the text and can't remember
      what she will see in the future.
   2. The optional argument of \item[...] in the description environment is
      converted to isolatin1 if applicable, but not LaTeX converted. Try `\item
      [Best~Friends]'.
   3. The \section* command is accepted, but as I don't know how to produce a
      section without numbering it in rtf it does precisly this: print a
      section number.
   4. CmdLabel can generate rtf1.4 Page references and Bookmarks, but Section
      References only with restrictions: The section reference copies the
      information of the `.aux' file to a locked rtf field. The better way
      would be, to include the section text in a bookmark if there is a label
      following, and write the bookmark with the label name, since then Word
      could update the section information.
   5. The diagnostics routine does not output the correct (actual)
      inputfilename. (`.aux', `.bbl', \input).
   6. The @@l2r@{@} macro of this document does NOT produce the correct LaTeX-
      Logo. Somebody can send me a correct version, and for LaTeX2e also?!
   7. To provide the end-of-line-code features a "cleaned up" temporary file is
      written and then read in as inputfile. This gets us into other troubles
      with input redirection and `\input'/`\include''ed LaTeX-files. This
      procedure is meant as a temporary means to provide this functionality and
      will be removed in the future.

@section Reporting Bugs 

Report bugs to Jorge.Lehner@@gmx.net (Georg Lehner). Ralf Schlatterbeck is no
longer the maintainer and will forward all mails refering LaTeX2rtf to me.
Please give the following information and observe the following guidelines when
reporting a bug in the program:
Tell me the version of the program. For the executable you get the version by
specifying the `-V' option to LaTeX2rtf. For the sources the version is the
version number of the file `version.h'.
The Operating System and version number where you are running or trying to
install LaTeX2rtf. Be sure to check the file `Makefile' for settings that may
be specific to your machine, especially for some versions of SunOS there may be
settings which are needed to compile successfully. Do this before writing to
me.
If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include a short
LaTeX file along with a description of the problem. Do not send me large LaTeX
or rtf files, I simply do not have the time to wade through large files to
search for a bug! If necessary (i.e., the program produces wrong or invalid
rtf), send the rtf file that is produced along with the LaTeX input file.
Be patient with me. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I did not
write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to answer to your
question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in upcoming releases.

@node Todo List ,  , Reporting Bugs , LaTeX2rtf under Development
@section Todo List 

    * Make this Manual more consistent, the Todo and Known Bug List shorter and
      the Features List longer.
    * Harmonize all of the error and warning messages.
    * Put warnings everwhere aplicable about producing RTF 1.4 tokens.
    * Provide a Testsuite.
    * Be more specific about implementing on Unix Platforms.
    * Provide an Error and Warning recovery guide to the user.
    * Explain details of the MSDOS executable in a separate chapter.
    * Add a chapter with lists of all LaTeX commands that convert, and that do
      not convert to RTF, including their status (for future releases, never,
      partially functional, ...).
    * The following comes from Ralf: - Redesign the input routines -> do not
      use lseek -> then the program can read from pipes. - Change the Makefile
      to use default rules for generating .o files. Also use generic rules in
      some other places (clean target) - For ignored commands the number of
      arguments to ignore should also be given - Environment definition
      produced with \newtheorem should be supported - Move version control
      archive (currently RCS) to CVS. - Change how the current version is
      computed (currently version.h defines the version of the whole package
      this should change to a CVS (or RCS) version tag from which a version.h
      file should automatically be generated).
