.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I latex2rtf
command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format. The text and much of the formatting
information is translated to RTF.
.TP
.B \-a auxfile
Used to specify a particular cross-referencing file.
When this option is omitted, the 
.I auxfile 
is assumed to be the same as 
.I inputfile
with the .tex suffix replaced by .aux.
.TP
.B \-b bblfile
Used to specify a particular bibliography file 
When this option is omitted, the
.I bblfile 
is assumed to be the same as 
.I inputfile
with the .tex suffix replaced by .bbl.
.TP 
.B \-C codepage
used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX
document for non-ansi characters. 
.I codepage
may be one of the following:
ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865, decmulti,
cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9,
and next.  The default behavior is to use ansinew (same as cp1252).
.TP 
.B \-d#
Write extra debugging output to stderr.  Higher numbers cause more debugging output
and range from 0 (only errors) to 6 (absurdly many messages). The default is
1 (Warnings and Errors only).
.TP 
.B \-h
Print a short usage note
.TP 
.B \-i language
used to set the idiom or language used in the LaTeX document
.I language
may be one of the following
afrikaans, german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic, polish,
swedish, basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil, esperanto, irish,
romanian, usorbian, breton, estonian, italian, samin, welsh, catalan,
finnish, latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian, serbian, czech, french,
magyar, slovak, danish, galician, norsk, slovene.  The default is english.
.TP 
.B \-l
Assume LaTeX source uses ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) special characters (default behavior). 
.TP 
.B \-o outputfile
Redirect output to
.I outputfile
Unless an 
.I outputfile
is specified with the -o option, the resulting RTF is produced in a file with .tex
replaced by .rtf.
.TP 
.B \-M#
where # selects the type of equation conversion.  -M3 is the default and
converts both inline and displayed equations to RTF.  -M6 converts inline 
equations to RTF and displayed equations to bitmaps. -M12 converts inline 
and displayed equations to bitmaps.  Bitmap conversion requires a working 
latex2png script.  Producing bitmaps is slow.
.TP 
.B \-P /path/to/cfg
used to specify the directory that contains the @code{.cfg} files
.TP 
.B \-S
Use semicolons to separate arguments in RTF fields.
This is needed when the machine opening the RTF file
has a version of Word that uses commas for decimal points.
.TP
.B \-V
Prints version on standard output and exits.
.TP 
.B \-W 
Emit warnings directly in RTF file.  Handy for catching things that do not 
get translated correctly.
.TP 
.B \-Z# 
Add # close braces to end of RTF file.  (Handy when file is not converted
correctly and will not open in another word processor.)
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
The configuration files are searched first in any directory specified
by -P, then in the location specified by the environment variable 
RTFPATH, and finally in the location LIBDIR specified when 
.I
latex2rtf
was compiled.  If the configuration files are not found then
.I
latex2rtf 
aborts.  The configuration files allow additional fonts to be 
recognized, additional simple commands to be translation, and 
additional commands to be ignored.
.SH CAUTION
The input file should be a correct LaTeX file. Use LaTeX
to find and fix errors before using
.I latex2rtf.
.PP
The configuration files 
.B direct.cfg
and
.B fonts.cfg
are in the correct directory.
You may have to change
.B fonts.cfg
or
.B direct.cfg
to suit your needs.
.SH BUGS
Some might consider RTF to be a bug.
.PP
Some environments are currently ignored. 
.PP
Translation without a LaTeX generated .aux file is poor.
.PP
Table conversion is particularly poor at the moment.
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Report bugs to to the bug tracking system at http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/. 
Only report bugs for the latest version of
.I latex2rtf
that is available.  Please identify your operating system.

.PP
If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include
a 
.I short
LaTeX file along with a description of the problem.  The shorter the 
LaTeX file, the quicker your bug will get addressed.
Do not bother to send RTF files, since these are usually unhelpful.
