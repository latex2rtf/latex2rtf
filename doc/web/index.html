	<p>latex2rtf is a translator program to convert LaTeX formatted text files
	into &ldquo;rich text format&rdquo; (RTF) files. RTF
	is a published standard format by Microsoft. This standard can be
	ambiguous in places, but RTF is supported by many text editors.  
	Specifically, it is supported by Microsoft Word.  This means that
	the conversion of a LaTeX document to RTF allows anyone with a
	copy of Word to convert LaTeX files to Word .doc or .docx files.
	
	<p>Features
	<ul>
	<li> Conversion of a wide range of input encodings
	<li> Conversion of equations (unfortunately using the broken
	     Microsoft implementation of EQ fields)
	<li> Conversion of tables
	<li> Conversion of graphics
	<li> Conversion of cross-references
	<li> Conversion of bibliographies
	</ul>

	<p>The Word-centric conversion of LaTeX files is because that is
	what I needed.  Perhaps one day this will change, but because the
	Microsoft field extensions are poorly supported by Open Office (for
	good reason), the emitted RTF files tend to be Microsoft Word specific.

	<p>latex2rtf translates the text and as much of the formatting information
    from LaTeX to RTF. Be forewarned that the typeset output is not
    nearly as good as what you would get from using LaTeX
    directly. So, why bother translating? Consider,
    <ul>
    <li>You use LaTeX and hate everything associated with Microsoft.
    Nevertheless, you have to share your documents with people who don't
    even know that there are alternatives.
    <li>You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine LaTeX documents.
    Unfortunately, you are &ldquo;on the other side&rdquo; and need to work
    with this obscure LaTeX file.
    <li>You like LaTeX and BibTeX. You interact with the rest of the
    world. Unfortunately, your main collaborator is an unrepentant Word
    user.
    </ul>

	<p>There are drawbacks to the conversion process. In fact, don't expect any LaTeX
    file to be converted as you would like, don't expect it to be converted without errors or
    warnings, and don't be especially surprised when it doesn't convert at all.  LaTeX2RTF is
    known to have many bugs and many missing features. Paradoxically, this number seems to
    grow more and more with each day.  However, we can categorically state that there are some
    special cases in which a LaTeX file will be translated to RTF satisfactorily by
    LaTeX2RTF &mdash; This was sort of disclaimer, ok? OK!
