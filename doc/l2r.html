In 1994 the first Version of LaTeX2rtf was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer of
the Viena University supervised by Ralf Schlatterbeck in a one-semester course. They created a simple
@latex{} parser and added most of the infrastructure for the program. This
was version 1.0 of LaTeX2rtf.  In 1995, work on LaTeX2rtf{} was
continued in another 
one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko. The result was LaTeX2rtf version
1.5.  <A HREF="mailto:ralf@zoo.priv.at">Ralf Schlatterbeck</A> maintained and extended LaTeX2rtf until 1998.


<P>
In 1998 <A HREF="mailto:jorge_lehner@gmx.net">Georg Lehner</A> found the reference to LaTeX2rtf on
the <A HREF="http://www.fz-juelich.de/isr/1/texconv.htm">TeX Conversion Webpage</A>  of
<A HREF="mailto:W.Hennings@fz-juelich.de">Wilfried Hennings</A> and added some functionality and took
over the maintainence of the program.  The last version release by Georg is 1.8aa.
Wilfried Hennings now coordinates
the development of the program and maintains the project on 
<A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</A> where there are also
(low volume) mailing lists for users
<A HREF="mailto:latex2rtf-users@lists.sourceforge.net">latex2rtf-users@lists.sourceforge.net</A>
and developers

<P>
As of October 2001, version 1.9k of LaTeX2rtf is available. 
Afterwards there shall be a jump to Version 2.0 with a complete redesign, but
this is not history but future ...


<P>
The contents of this manual is composed by copying shamelessly what was
available in the original sources and documentation.




<H1><A NAME="SEC2" HREF="l2r.html#TOC2">Introduction</A></H1>

<P>
LaTeX2rtf is a translator program from @latex{} text into "rich text format"
files.  These files are commonly referred to  as RTF files and are published
standard format by Microsoft.  This standard is somewhat ambiguous in places
and Microsoft ignores various parts of the standard that are inconvenient, but
RTF widely used by many WYSIWIG text editors and is supported by
Microsoft Word and Word for Windows. RTF can be exported and/or
imported by several textprocessors.


<P>
LaTeX2rtf translates the text and much of the formatting information from @latex{}
to RTF, but the typeset output is not nearly as good as what you would get from
using @latex{} directly.  So, why bother translating? There are three purposes:



<OL>
<LI>

You use @latex{} and hate everything beginning with MS-@enddots{} But
you have to share your documents to people which don't even now that
there exist other things than MS-@enddots{}
      
<LI>

You know somebody who frequently sends you very fine @latex{} documents.
Unfortunately, you are "on the other side" and need to import her
files, steal some part and then desktop publish it in your fine
MS-... environment.
      
<LI>

You maybe have both things, @latex{} and MS-..., or you don't. But
you like the way how @latex{} and friends work, and you don't want to
type in a letter to your friends with about 345 characters and end up
with a <TT>`.doc'</TT> file of 32,845 byte. So you edit your documents
either with <TT>`edit.com'</TT> or <TT>`edlin'</TT> in the structured form that
@latex{} encourages, and then you use MS-..., or MS-...-Viewer
or any other RTF-rendering software to print out your file.  Yes, this
somewhat bizarre, but we are all somewhat bizarre, are we not? 
</OL>

<P>
There are drawbacks to the conversion process. In fact, don't expect any
@latex{} file to be converted like you want, don't expect it to be
converted without errors or warnings, and don't be especially surprised
if it doesn't convert at all.  LaTeX2rtf is known to have many bugs and
many missing features. The number seems to grow more and more each day. 
Nevertheless, we can categorically state that there are some special
cases,  in which a @latex{} file will be translated to RTF
satisfactorily by LaTeX2rtf -- This was sort of disclaimer, ok? Ok!


<P>
@latex{} is a system for typesetting text and therefore it focuses on
the logical structure of a document, whilst RTF is meant to be a
transport format for a family of Desktop Publishing Software, dealing
mostly with the design of a text.


<P>
Although the possible different commands and styles in @latex{} are much
more flexible and standardized than in RTF, only a small subset of
commands has been implemented to date.  See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC34">Unimplemented Features</A>.


<P>
Some of the capabilities of LaTeX2rtf are restricted in scope or buggy. 
See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC36">Known Bugs</A>.


<P>
RTF is a moving target, because Microsoft does not stop inventing new
extensions and features for it. So you cannot view newer RTF files with
older word Processors.  LaTeX2rtf eventually will generate RTF output that
is unreadable with your Program.  The syntax and semantics of RTF are
somewhat artistic, i.e., you can generate a syntactically correct RTF
file that cannot be displayed by some/most word processors.


<P>
For more details on RTF look at the RTF-Tools by Paul DuBois, and the
corresponding newsgroups, etc. <A HREF="http://www.primate.wisc.edu/">http://www.primate.wisc.edu/</A>




<H1><A NAME="SEC3" HREF="l2r.html#TOC3">Availability</A></H1>

<P>
LaTeX2rtf is available for many Unix Platforms, for the Macintosh, and for MS-DOS, 
including all versions of MS Windows 95.


<P>
The MS-DOS version (1.8aa and up) will also run under all MS Windows versions.
It requires an i386 processor or better.
The Win32 Version requires <A HREF="http://sources.redhat.com/cygwin/">Cygnus-Cygwin32</A>. 
As the MS-DOS version (1.8aa and up) will also run under all MS
windows versions, the Win32 version has been discontinued.


<P>
Subsequent to 1.8aa, <A HREF="mailto:prahl@ece.ogi.edu">Scott Prahl</A> has fixed
many bugs, improved handling of tabular environments, 
added code to significantly improve handling of equations,
added macro expansion of <CODE>\newcommand</CODE> definitions, 
improved handling of citations, and added some support for
<CODE>\includegraphics</CODE> files.


<P>
You find the latest version on <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">SourceForge</A>
and -- with some delay -- on CTAN sites: e.g., <A HREF="http://www.dante.de">http://www.dante.de</A> or
<A HREF="http://www.ctan.org">http://www.ctan.org</A>.


<P>
There are a couple of persons working on the LaTeX2rtf revival, coordinated by
<A HREF="mailto:W.Hennings@fz-juelich.de">Wilfried Hennings</A>.
Contact the mailing_list for the latest news.

<H2><A NAME="SEC5" HREF="l2r.html#TOC5">General</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="SEC6" HREF="l2r.html#TOC6">@acronym{UNIX}</A></H2>

<P>
The documentation of the program is found in the <TT>`doc/'</TT> directory in the
file <TT>`latex2rtf.info'</TT> in the GNU info format.  For your convenience, you
can find <TT>`.html'</TT> and <TT>`.pdf'</TT> versions of the manual there as well.


<P>
To install (on a @acronym{UNIX} system)

<OL>
<LI>

Edit  <TT>`Makefile'</TT> for your local configuration. The install part supports
multiple directories to install to, you will normally only need one. Be
sure to correctly configure the <TT>`LIBDIR'</TT> variable to the directory where
support files (ending in <TT>`.cfg'</TT>) will be found by the program. This is
normally the same as the <TT>`LIBINSTALL'</TT> variable.

<LI><CODE>make</CODE>

<LI>If this is not your first time installation, you may want to preserve

  your old configuration (<TT>`*.cfg'</TT>) files. Copy them to a safe place before
  installing.

<LI><CODE>make install</CODE>

<LI>If you have problems with make install (for example if your <CODE>mkdir</CODE>

  doesn't support the @option{-p} option) and you do not need multiple install
  targets, try:
  <CODE>make simple_install</CODE>
  
<LI>Define the environment variable @env{RTFPATH}. This is typically

<CODE>/usr/local/lib/latex2rtf</CODE>

<LI>Run <CODE>make test</CODE> to test your installation

</OL>

<P>
Open the <TT>`latex2rtf'</TT> directory and type

<PRE>
make
make test
sudo make install
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC7" HREF="l2r.html#TOC7">Windows</A></H2>

<P>
The file <TT>`L2R.BAT'</TT> is for use with the @acronym{DJGPP} generated version 
<TT>`LATEX2RT.EXE'</TT>.


<P>
The @acronym{UNIX} and Mac distributions do not contain an executable for DOS / Windows.
Instead, get the DOS / Windows port as file <TT>`latex2rtf-x.xx_dos.zip'</TT>
(where x.xx is the version number) from  <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/</A>




<H2><A NAME="SEC8" HREF="l2r.html#TOC8">Macintosh</A></H2>

<P>
If you want a MacOS X version, make sure that you have installed
the developer tools CD that is appropriate for your OS version, and
then follow the directions above for @acronym{UNIX} installation.


<P>
There is a classic MacOS PPC port of the 1.9k of LaTeX2rtf and I have
made a binary distribution of this application.  Unfortunately, because
I (Scott Prahl) do all development under MacOS X, the binaries for
the Classic version often lags (far) behind the current @acronym{UNIX}
version.


<P>
To convert a @latex{} file, just drag the file onto the LaTeX2rtf application
icon.  The translation is best if there are <TT>`.aux'</TT> and <TT>`.bbl'</TT> 
files in the same folder as the <TT>`.tex'</TT> file to be converted.  These
should be generated using @latex{} and <TT>`bibtex'</TT>.  




<H2><A NAME="SEC9" HREF="l2r.html#TOC9">Problems Compiling</A></H2>

<P>
The code for LaTeX2rtf is standard @acronym{ANSI} C.  Some possible pitfalls
are

<UL>
<LI>Not correctly defining your compiler in the Makefile.

The default is to use <CODE>gcc</CODE>.  

<LI>Encountering errors because the compiler options.  During development

all compiler warnings are turned on.  However, different compilers have
different interpretations of @option{-Wall} and @option{-pedantic} and 
so may generate errors that were not found in a different development
system.  Plese report these, but a quick fix is to remove all compiler
options.

<LI>Not defining @env{RTFPATH}.

<LI>Not defining @env{HAS_NO_STRDUP} in the Makefile when your system

lacks this facility.
</UL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC10" HREF="l2r.html#TOC10">Problems with <CODE>make test</CODE></A></H2>

<P>
All the files in the <TT>`test'</TT> directory are converted (with more or less
success) using LaTeX2rtf and are tested before each CVS check-in and with
all released tarballs.  If you have successfully compiled LaTeX2rtf then
problems are probably caused by



<UL>

<LI>Not defining @env{RTFPATH}.

<LI>Not defining @env{HAS_NO_STRDUP} in the Makefile when your system

lacks this facility.
</UL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC11" HREF="l2r.html#TOC11">Using LaTeX2RTF</A></H1>



<H2><A NAME="SEC12" HREF="l2r.html#TOC12">General assumptions made by LaTeX2RTF</A></H2>

<P>
LaTeX2rtf assumes that the <TT>`.tex'</TT> file you want to convert is a valid
@latex{} document.  The chances of a successful LaTeX2rtf conversion are 
slightly better than the proverbial snowball's if the <TT>`.tex'</TT> file
doesn't <CODE>latex</CODE> properly.  Use
@latex{} to find and correct errors before using LaTeX2rtf. 


<P>
User defined @latex{} commands are ignored. If you are familiar with the RTF
format and the commands can be translated by simply inserting a format string
into the RTF file you can add these commands to the <TT>`direct.cfg'</TT> configuration
file.  See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC28">Direct Conversion Configuration</A>.


<P>
To correctly convert font names you must edit the <TT>`fonts.cfg'</TT> configuration file.


<P>
You have to specify the font names you use and how the @latex{} default font names
should be converted to RTF.  See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC30">Font Configuration</A>.
@latex{} variables and user defined commands are not evaluated. They will be
simply ignored. To let LaTeX2rtf know the names of variables you can add them
in the <TT>`ignore.cfg'</TT> file.  See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC29">Ignore Command Configuration</A>.


<P>
The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the support
files (all files ending in <TT>`.cfg'</TT>). If no file is found during the search in the
search-path or if the environment variable is not set, the compiled-in default
for the configuration-file directory is used. If the files are not found at all
the program aborts.


<P>
In the MS-DOS version the search path is separated by `;' in the Unix version
by `:'. For the paths themselves apply `\' and `/'. A separator may appear at
the beginning or ending of RTFPATH.


<P>
Make sure that the configuration files are in the correct directory. LaTeX2rtf
will need at least <TT>`fonts.cfg'</TT>, <TT>`direct.cfg'</TT>, <TT>`ignore.cfg'</TT>, <TT>`english.cfg'</TT>.
You may have to change one ore more of them to suit your needs.
See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC25">Configuring LaTeX2RTF</A>.


<P>
See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC35">Missing and faulty command line options</A>, for actual implementations
irregularities.


<P>
See See section Reporting_Bugs on how to reach the maintainer.




<H2><A NAME="SEC13" HREF="l2r.html#TOC13">LaTeX2RTF Options</A></H2>

<P>
The LaTeX2rtf command converts a @latex{} file into RTF text format. The text and
much of the formatting information is translated to RTF making the new file
look similar to the original.  The command line syntax is:



<PRE>
latex2rtf [-options] inputfile.[tex]
</PRE>

<P>
If inputfile is not specified, standard input is read.
The <CODE>-options</CODE> may consist of one or more of the following


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><CODE>-a auxfile</CODE>
<DD>
specify an <TT>`.aux'</TT> file (for table and figure references) that
differs from <TT>`inputfile.aux'</TT>. If this is omitted, the name of the
inputfile with the suffix replaced <TT>`.aux''</TT>will be taken.  You must
provide both files (<TT>`.tex'</TT> and the <TT>`.aux'</TT>) to be able to
convert cross-references in a @latex{} file.  The <TT>`.aux'</TT> is created
by running the <TT>`inputfile.tex'</TT> through <CODE>latex</CODE>.

<DT><CODE>-b bblfile</CODE>
<DD>
Unless an <TT>`bblfile'</TT> is specified with the <CODE>-b</CODE> option, LaTeX2rtf uses a
<TT>`inputfile.bbl'</TT>.  The <TT>`bblfile'</TT> file is used for citations and is typically
created by running <TT>`inputfile.aux'</TT> through <TT>`bibtex'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>-d</CODE>
<DD>
The @option{-d} option determines the amount of debugging information to send to
stderr while translating. `0' means only Errors, `1' Warning Messages
(default) also.  These numbers can go as high as `7'.

<DT><CODE>-l language</CODE>
<DD>
used to set the language used by the @latex{} document.  Typically, this
is specified in a @latexe{} document by including
<CODE>\usepackage[language]{babel}</CODE> where <CODE>language</CODE> is one of
the languages supported by the <CODE>babel</CODE> package.   All languages
listed in the babel system are supported so far as translations for
"Chapter," "References," and the like.  Specific support for
specific options of the german style package are explictly supported. 
The french translated names are found in the <TT>`french.cfg'</TT> file in
the <TT>`cfg/'</TT> directory.  See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC31">Language Configuration</A>.

<DT><CODE>-o outputfile</CODE>
<DD>
Unless an <TT>`outputfile'</TT> is specified with the <CODE>-o</CODE> option, the resulting RTF 
filename is
formed by removing <TT>`.tex'</TT> from the <TT>`inputfile'</TT> and appending <TT>`.rtf'</TT>.

<DT><CODE>-C codepage</CODE>
<DD>
used to specify the character set (code page) used in the @latex{} document. 
This is only important when non-ansi characters are included in the @latex{}
document.
Typically this is done in a @latexe{} file by using
<CODE>\usepackage[codepage]{inputenc}</CODE>
This command is not needed if the above command is already in the @latexe{}
file.  You may select any of the following code pages:
ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865, decmulti, cp1250, 
cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9, and next.  Support
for the Eastern European codepages is pretty weak at the moment.  The default
behavior is to use ansinew (code page 1252).

<DT><CODE>-V</CODE>
<DD>
prints version information on standard output and exits.

</DL>



<H2><A NAME="SEC14" HREF="l2r.html#TOC14">Debugging</A></H2>

<P>
With the @option{-d} option you can specify how much of its internal working LaTeX2rtf
is reporting.


<P>
If there is a logfile specified the output goes to this file. Nonetheless
Warnings and Errors are logged to stderr always.
(Actually) possible values of @option{-d} are



<OL>
<LI>

only errors (=@option{-q}).
<LI>

Translation Warnings (default).
<LI>

does not really do anything at the moment
<LI>

Reasonably high level debugging messages
<LI>

Show all function calls
<LI>

Show all each character as it is processed
<LI>

Show processing of characters as they are output as well
</OL>



<H1><A NAME="SEC15" HREF="l2r.html#TOC15">Features</A></H1>

<P>
In this chapter you find what styles is LaTeX2rtf supposed to translate
correctly to RTF.




<H2><A NAME="SEC16" HREF="l2r.html#TOC16">LaTeX2e</A></H2>

<P>
LaTeX2rtf understands most of the commands introduced with @latexe{}.  It supports both
the old 2.09 version of <CODE>\documentstyle[options]{format#}</CODE> and the newer
<CODE>\documentclass[options]{format}</CODE>.  




<H2><A NAME="SEC17" HREF="l2r.html#TOC17">Input Encoding</A></H2>

<P>
It is not necesary to specify the @option{-C} option if you use <CODE>\usepackage{isolatin1}</CODE>
or <CODE>\documentstyle[isolatin1]{...}</CODE>. LaTeX2rtf automagically detects these
packages/style options and switches to processing of ISO-Latin1 codes.




<H2><A NAME="SEC18" HREF="l2r.html#TOC18">Language Support</A></H2>

<P>
The following languages from the Babel package are supported: afrikaans,
german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic, polish, swedish,
basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil, esperanto, irish, romanian,
usorbian, breton, estonian, italian, samin, welsh, catalan, finnish,
latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian, serbian, czech, french, magyar,
slovak, danish, galician, norsk, slovene,


<P>
The only thing that these files do is to translate various words usually
emitted by @latex{} during processing.  For example, this ensures that the
LaTeX2rtf will provide the correct translation of the word "Chapter" in
the converted document.


<P>
You can select any of the above languages using the @option{-l} option.  This
is not needed if your @latex{} file contains <CODE>\usepackage[language]{babel}</CODE>.


<P>
Encountering the `german' package or documentstyle option (by H.Partl of the
Viena University) makes LaTeX2rtf behave like that: German Quotes, German
Umlauts by <CODE>"a</CODE>, etc@enddots{}  This support is programmed directly into LaTeX2rtf
and supporting similar features for other languages will require patching the
source code.


<P>
See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC31">Language Configuration</A>, for details on how to write a <TT>`language.cfg'</TT> file
for your language by yourself.




<H2><A NAME="SEC19" HREF="l2r.html#TOC19">Cross References</A></H2>

<P>
Cross references are broken currently.




<H2><A NAME="SEC20" HREF="l2r.html#TOC20">Equations</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="SEC21" HREF="l2r.html#TOC21">Tables</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="SEC22" HREF="l2r.html#TOC22">Graphics</A></H2>



<H2><A NAME="SEC23" HREF="l2r.html#TOC23">Pagestyles</A></H2>

<P>
If there is no <CODE>\pagestyle</CODE> command, the RTF output is generated as with plain
pagestyle, i.e. each page get's its page number centered at the bottom.


<P>
You must turn this off with the \pagestyle{empty} command in the @latex{} file if
you don't want pagenumbers.
The headings and myheadings styles are silently ignored by now.
The twosided option to the \documentstyle or \documentclass produces the
corresponding RTF tokens.
Note that these features require RTF Version 1.4.




<H2><A NAME="SEC24" HREF="l2r.html#TOC24">Hyperlatex</A></H2>

<P>
Otfried Schwarzkopf has created the "Hyperlatex Markup Language" which is a
"little package that allows you to use @latex{} to prepare documents in HTML."
It brings an Emacs lisp program with it to convert the Hyperlatex file to HTML.
Hyperlatex can be obtained from the CTAN-sites, see section Availability.
There are two handsome commands that avoid typing: \link and \xlink that
generate an "internal" label which then is used in the following \Ref and
\Pageref commands.


<P>
@latex{} makes it possible to write `\link{anchor}[ltx]{label}', which typesets:
`anchor ltx'. LaTeX2rtf does NOT support this aproach since the optional
parameter is thrown away right now, See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC33">LaTeX2RTF under Development</A>.


<P>
Note that you have to update your <TT>`.cfg'</TT> files if you are upgrading, since
there are a lot of HTML oriented commands in Hyperlatex that we simply can
`ignore'.




<H1><A NAME="SEC25" HREF="l2r.html#TOC25">Configuring LaTeX2RTF</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter is out of date and needs to be revised.




<H2><A NAME="SEC26" HREF="l2r.html#TOC26">Input processing</A></H2>

<P>
On processing input LaTeX2rtf first converts the @latex{} special characters. If
it encounters one of the standard commands it is converted internally. If a
command is not known to LaTeX2rtf it is first looked up in the section
<TT>`direct.cfg'</TT> and the RTF code specified there is output. If not found there it
is looked up in the section <TT>`ignore.cfg'</TT>, since there are a lot of @latex{}
commands that do not show up in the .dvi output (cross reference information
and the like), or that we are not able or willing to convert to rtf.


<P>
You can use <TT>`ignore.cfg'</TT> if you get bored to see "WARNING: command: foo not
found - ignored" and you don't need `foo' in your Word(R) document, but it
would be nice to send me the offending command to include it in the
distributions configuration files.


<P>
LaTeX2rtf accepts Unix-like, MSDOS and Macintosh line ending codes (\n, \r\n
and \r).


<P>
Optionally the input is interpreted as iso-latin1 encoded, section Character
encoding.




<H2><A NAME="SEC27" HREF="l2r.html#TOC27">Output formatting</A></H2>

<P>
Since the RTF-Readers normally have their own mood of typesetting and font
handling we have to convert the @latex{} fonts to RTF fontnames.   See section <A HREF="l2r.html#SEC30">Font Configuration</A>.


<P>
If you have information about adequate font mappings from Metafont to TrueType
fonts please send me a note, so I can improve the resemblence beetween @latex{}
and RTF output. I would be happy to include a font resource list in this
manual.


<P>
Nevertheless you are free to make all fancy things you like, map \rm on
WingDings if you feel somewhat strange today...


<P>
The standard @latex{} styles have some fixed Title names like `Part', `Reference'
or `Bibliography' that appeared in English or German in the output with the
original versions of LaTeX2rtf.


<P>
Now you can determine what should appear at this places with an appropriate
section <TT>`language.cfg'</TT> file.
Actually I grep-ed the descriptions out of the `babel' files from teTeX to
supply english, german and spanish translations.


<P>
On writing output, LaTeX2rtf generates \n (lf, Newline) as line ending code.
Your RTF-Reader should accept this on any platform. If you ftp your RTf-file
from or to MSDOS platforms the line ending code can be converted to \r\n. As
this should also be legal to any RTf-Reader the resulting RTF-rendering should
not be affected.




<H2><A NAME="SEC28" HREF="l2r.html#TOC28">Direct Conversion Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
The file <TT>`direct.cfg'</TT> is used for converting @latex{} commands by simple text
replacement. The format consists of lines with a @latex{} command with backslash
followed by comma. The rest of the line until a '.' character will be written
to the RTF file when the command is recognized in the @latex{} file. Lines
starting with a '#' character are ignored. After the '.' everything is ignored
to end of line. To select a specific font use *fontname*. Make sure that the
font name fontname is listed in the fonts configuration file at least as dummy.


<P>
To write the '*' character use "**". 

<PRE>
\alpha,{\f*Symbol* a}. #alpha under Windows Symbol Font
\copyright,{\ansi\'a9\pc}.
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC29" HREF="l2r.html#TOC29">Ignore Command Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
The file <TT>`ignore.cfg'</TT> is used for defining how to ignore certain commands. This
file is used for recognition of @latex{}-variables, user defined variables, and
some simple commands. All variables are ignored but the converter must know the
names to correctly ignore assignments to variables. Lines in this file consist
of a variable-name with backslash, followed by comma and the type of the
variable followed by '.'. Possible Types are:


<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`NUMBER'</SAMP>
<DD>
simple numeric value
<DT><SAMP>`MEASURE'</SAMP>
<DD>
numeric value with following unit of measure
<DT><SAMP>`OTHER'</SAMP>
<DD>
ignores anything to the first character after '=' and from there to next
space. e.g., <CODE>\setbox\bak=\hbox</CODE>
<DT><SAMP>`COMMAND'</SAMP>
<DD>
ignores anything to next '\' and from there to the occurence of anything
but a letter e.g., <CODE>\newbox\bak</CODE>
<DT><SAMP>`SINGLE'</SAMP>
<DD>
ignore single command e.g., <CODE>\noindent</CODE>
<DT><SAMP>`PARAMETER'</SAMP>
<DD>
ignores a command with one parameter e.g., <CODE>\foo{bar}</CODE>
<DT><SAMP>`PACKAGE'</SAMP>
<DD>
does not produce a Warning message if PACKAGE is encountered, e.g.,
`PACKAGE,kleenex.'
<DT><SAMP>`ENVCMD'</SAMP>
<DD>
proceses contents of unknown environment as if it were plain @latex{}
eg. `ENVCMD,environ.' Therefore <CODE>\begin{environ} text
\end{environ}</CODE>' as `text'.
<DT><SAMP>`ENVIRONMENT'</SAMP>
<DD>
ignores contents of that environment, e.g., with `ENVIRONMENT,ifhtml.'
<CODE>\begin{ifhtml} text \end{ifhtml}</CODE> ignores `text'.
</DL>

<P>
The types are in upper case exactly as above. Do not use spaces. Lines starting
with a '#' character are ignored. After the '.' everything is ignored to end of
line. Example:

<PRE>
\pagelength,MEASURE.'
</PRE>



<H2><A NAME="SEC30" HREF="l2r.html#TOC30">Font Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
The file <TT>`fonts.cfg'</TT> contains the fonts conversion table. A line consists of a
font name in @latex{} followed by comma and a font name in RTF. The end is marked
by a '.'. No spaces are allowed. The @latex{} font will be converted to the RTF
font if encountered in the @latex{} file. If multiple translations for a @latex{}
font are specified, only the first is used. All fonts in a @latex{} file that are
not in this file will be mapped to the default font. All RTF fonts listed in
this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or not. Lines starting
with a '#' character are ignored. After the '.' everything is ignored to end of
line. To add a RTF font not used as substitute for a @latex{} font - for example a
Symbol font used in <TT>`direct.cfg'</TT> -- use a dummy @latex{} name like in the following

<PRE>
Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.
</PRE>

<P>
Make sure you use the correct font name. Take care of spaces in font names. The
default fonts are named Roman (command \rm), Slanted (command \sl), Sans Serif
(command \sf), Typewriter (command \tt).




<H2><A NAME="SEC31" HREF="l2r.html#TOC31">Language Configuration</A></H2>

<P>
The file(s) <TT>`language.cfg'</TT> control the translation of @latex{}'s "hardcoded"
sectioning names.


<P>
I have put in what I found whith grep "\renewcommand" * in the @latex{} style
directory (teTex, babel), the tokens have the "name" stripped of and are all
uppercase i.e. `\contentsname' mutes to `CONTENTS'. Actually LaTeX2rtf uses
only REF and PART.

<P>
Actually there is an english, a french, a german and a spanish Version. You are
welcome contribute with <TT>`language.cfg'</TT> files in other idioms to include them in
the distribution. Send them to <A HREF="mailto:Jorge.Lehner@gmx.net">Jorge.Lehner@gmx.net</A> or <A HREF="mailto:W.Hennings@fz-juelich.de">W.Hennings@fz-juelich.de</A>.




<H1><A NAME="SEC32" HREF="l2r.html#TOC32">Error Messages and Logging of LaTeX2RTF Activity</A></H1>

<P>
Note: Error reporting and logging is one of the most chaotic aspects of the
program. There are a lot of inconsistencies, but I hope to get it cleaner with
time.


<P>
As stated in the Debugging section, LaTeX2rtf provides a means to control the amount
of information it puts out on stderr.
<DL COMPACT>

<DT><SAMP>`Fatal error messages'</SAMP>
<DD>
indicate a bug in the source code. PLEASE report them, if they do not
apear in the documentation, see section Reporting_Bugs. Note: By now you
won't be informed by the program if an error is fatal or not. Try to find
it out by context ...

<DT><SAMP>`Error messages'</SAMP>
<DD>
always abort the program. They are thrown on conditions that do not allow
further converting of the input file, but should be either documented as
missing or unimplemented feature, or should be able to be corrected by
the user (e.g. missing <TT>`.cfg'</TT> files).

<DT><SAMP>`Warning messages'</SAMP>
<DD>
inform you, that there is some conversion loss from @latex{} to RTF, or that
the output file has some restrictions on some RTF Readers.
</DL>

<P>
Error and Warning messages should follow the GNU Coding standards, i.e. they
have the format:
"inputfile':line: Error|Warning: message'


<P>
Note: Neither the inputfile may be correctly announced if <CODE>\input</CODE>ing it, nor
can you rely on the linenumber, see section Known_Bugs.


<P>
The other messages only indicate `filename' (sometimes wrong) and linenumber
(also sometimes wrong) and some more or less usefull or interesting message.


<P>
Don't try to encounter any sense in debugging levels above 3, these are for my
own delight only and can change significantly between versions.




<H1><A NAME="SEC33" HREF="l2r.html#TOC33">LaTeX2RTF under Development</A></H1>

<P>
This chapter needs extensive revision.




<H2><A NAME="SEC34" HREF="l2r.html#TOC34">Unimplemented Features</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>@latex{} passes the optional parameters of \\documentstyle on to \\usepackage,

      LaTeX2rtf doesn't do this. LaTeX2rtf{}{} now accepts optional arguments to
      \\usepackage, but only uses them if they contain latin1
<LI>Add more input encoding features (other isolatin1 aproaches, other

      codepages,...).
<LI>Add the code to produce the corresponding chapter, section informations

      and page numbering with headings and myheadings pagestyles. Implement
		  <CODE>\markboth</CODE> and <CODE>\markright</CODE>.
<LI>To include the tableofcontents there would be two approaches: Transfer

      sectioning information, title text and let produce pagenumber by the rtf-
      reader. Scan and label all of the sectioning commands while reading and
      then construct the sectioning information using these labels. Needs two
      passes on @latex{} input.
<LI>Separate the Scope of the Document Environment from the Preample

      Environment.
<LI>Rewrite the parser to allow some kind of macro expansion hence more

      flexibility in configuration and extension.
<LI>newcounter, newenvironment, newcommand, ...

<LI>Include the GNU gettext package to internationalize LaTeX2rtf's Messages.

<LI>Switch over to GNU getopt() and long options.

</UL>

<P>
Here comes a list of @latex{}-commands that are not implemented:
`setlength, bigcap, dag, ddag, sharp, clubsuit, sim, nobreak, vspace, today,
left-((, right-))'




<H2><A NAME="SEC35" HREF="l2r.html#TOC35">Missing and faulty command line options</A></H2>

<P>
In this section you find comments about missing and buggy command line options.
  @option{-V}
       The Version information output is not compatible with the GNU Coding
      Standards.


<P>
  @option{-d}
       Information logging and Error reporting is not implemented consistently.
      So do expect confusing Messages and inconsistent format. The linenumber
      and filename of the offending spot in the input in the most cases is not
      correctly determined.
  `'
       There should be an option to intersperse RTF-Output with the @latex{}-input
      that produced it to have a better hand for debugging.
      
  @option{-o}
       Actually you must specify an output filename. Maybe further on the
      meaning of this option changes, as writing `-o filename' takes more
      typework then `&#62; filename'. Either you may specify the name, or you must
      not do it, depending on whether we choose to use GNU getopt or not.


<P>
  @option{-q}
       There should be a @option{-q} (quiet) option, to suppress Warning Messages. By
      now this can be achieved by the -d0 option.
      
  `-rmajor.minor'
       There should be an option that restrict the generation of RTF code with
      version greater than major,minor. Actually this is done at compile time.
      There are some Warning messages if "newer" RTF Code is generated, but it
      is not consistent at all.
      
  @option{-h}
       The default values for search pathes and switches changeable by
      commandlineoptions should be shown.


<P>
There is a need for a `--language' option (@option{-l} is yet used, and could be
changed to -e # (--encoding). @option{-i} as for `--international' is chosen meanwhile
so that the user can select an alternate language file, see section Output
formatting.


<P>
It would be useful to implement the GNU long option names, e.g.: `--debug',
`--output_file', `--quiet', etc.




<H2><A NAME="SEC36" HREF="l2r.html#TOC36">Known Bugs</A></H2>


<OL>
<LI>The first parameter of a \link{anchor}[ltx]{label} is converted to the

      rtf-output. Label is stored to hyperref for later use, the optional
      parameter is ignored. [ltx] should be processed as Otfried recommends it,
      to use for exclusive @latex{} output.e.g: \link{readhere}[~\Ref]{explaining:
      chapter}. Since {explaining:chapter} is yet read by @latex{} and hyperlatex
      when [...] is evaluated it produces the correct reference. LaTeX2rtf is
      only strolling from left to right through the text and can't remember
      what she will see in the future.
<LI>The optional argument of \item[...] in the description environment is

      converted to isolatin1 if applicable, but not @latex{} converted. Try `\item
      [Best~Friends]'.
<LI>The \section* command is accepted, but as I don't know how to produce a

      section without numbering it in rtf it does precisly this: print a
      section number.
<LI>CmdLabel can generate rtf1.4 Page references and Bookmarks, but Section

      References only with restrictions: The section reference copies the
      information of the `.aux' file to a locked rtf field. The better way
      would be, to include the section text in a bookmark if there is a label
      following, and write the bookmark with the label name, since then Word
      could update the section information.
<LI>The diagnostics routine does not output the correct (actual)

      inputfilename. (`.aux', `.bbl', <CODE>\input</CODE>).
<LI>The LaTeX2rtf{} macro of this document does NOT produce the correct @latex{}-

      Logo. Somebody can send me a correct version, and for @latexe{} also?!
<LI>To provide the end-of-line-code features a "cleaned up" temporary file is

      written and then read in as inputfile. This gets us into other troubles
      with input redirection and <CODE>\input</CODE> or <CODE>\include</CODE>ed @latex{}-files. This
      procedure is meant as a temporary means to provide this functionality and
      will be removed in the future.

<H2><A NAME="SEC37" HREF="l2r.html#TOC37">Reporting Bugs</A></H2>

<P>
Report bugs to <A HREF="mailto:Jorge.Lehner@gmx.net">Georg Lehner)</A>. Ralf Schlatterbeck is no
longer the maintainer and will forward all mails refering LaTeX2rtf to me.


<P>
Please give the following information and observe the following guidelines when
reporting a bug in the program:


<P>
Tell me the version of the program. For the executable you get the version by
specifying the @option{-V} option to LaTeX2rtf. For the sources the version is the
version number of the file `version.h'.


<P>
The Operating System and version number where you are running or trying to
install LaTeX2rtf. Be sure to check the file `Makefile' for settings that may
be specific to your machine, especially for some versions of SunOS there may be
settings which are needed to compile successfully. Do this before writing to
me.


<P>
If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include a short
@latex{} file along with a description of the problem. Do not send me large @latex{}
or rtf files, I simply do not have the time to wade through large files to
search for a bug! If necessary (i.e., the program produces wrong or invalid
rtf), send the rtf file that is produced along with the @latex{} input file.


<P>
Be patient with me. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I did not
write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to answer to your
question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in upcoming releases.




<H2><A NAME="SEC38" HREF="l2r.html#TOC38">Todo List</A></H2>


<UL>
<LI>Make this Manual more consistent, the Todo and Known Bug List shorter and

      the Features List longer.
<LI>Harmonize all of the error and warning messages.

<LI>Put warnings everwhere aplicable about producing RTF 1.4 tokens.

<LI>Provide a Testsuite.

<LI>Be more specific about implementing on Unix Platforms.

<LI>Provide an Error and Warning recovery guide to the user.

<LI>Explain details of the MS-DOS executable in a separate chapter.

<LI>Add a chapter with lists of all @latex{} commands that convert, and that do

      partially functional, ...).
<LI>The following comes from Ralf:


<OL>
<LI>Redesign the input routines to not

<LI>Move version control

      archive (currently RCS) to CVS. 
<LI>Change how the current version is

      computed (currently version.h defines the version of the whole package
      this should change to a CVS (or RCS) version tag from which a version.h
