latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by several textprocessors, including Microsoft Word
and Word for Windows.  It was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas
Granzer in a one-semester course in our department.  It was later
updated in another one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard
Trisko.  Ralf Schlatterbeck <ralf@zoo.priv.at> maintained and extended
it until 1998.  The current maintainer is Georg Lehner
<Jorge.Lehner@gmx.net>.  For the Copyright of the Program see the
file Copyright.

The documentation of the program is found in the doc/ directory in the
file latex2rtf.info in the GNU info format.  For your convenience find
a HTML and a PDF version of the manual there.

To install (on a UNIX system)
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration. The install part supports
  multiple directories to install to, you will normally only need one.
  Be sure to correctly configure the LIBDIR variable to the directory
  where support files (ending in .cfg) will be found by the program.
  This is normally the same as the LIBINSTALL variable.
- make
- make install
- If you have problems with make install (for example if your mkdir
  doesn't support the -p option) and you do not need multiple install
  targets, try:
  make simple_install
- If this is not your first-time installation, you may want to preserve
  you configuration (*.cfg) files. Copy them to a safe place and issue
  the command
  make install_and_delete_old_cfg
  (If you have problems with mkdir or other problems as above, use the
  make-target "simple_cfg_install")
- Try the program and report any errors to the address below.

Reporting bugs:
Please give the following information and observe the following
guidelines when reporting a bug in the program:
* Tell me the version of the program
  - For the executable you get the version by specifying the -V option
    to latex2rtf
  - For the sources the version is the version number of the file
    version.h
* The Operating System and version number where you are running or
  trying to install latex2rtf. Be sure to check the file Makefile for
  settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some
  versions of SunOS there may be settings which are needed to compile
  successfully. Do this BEFORE writing to me.
* If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include
  a SHORT latex file along with a description of the problem. DO NOT
  send me large latex or rtf files, I simply do not have the time to
  wade through large files to search for a bug! If necessary (i.e., the
  program produces wrong or invalid RTF), send the rtf file that is
  produced along with the latex input file.
* Be patient with me. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I
  did not write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to
  answer to your question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs
  in upcoming releases.

=========================================================================
The MSDOS version described in the following is available from 
ftp://ftp.cs.indiana.edu/pub/vmenkov/latex2rtf
By the time of this release, the version there may not be the latest
one.

        Latex2rtf adaptation for MS DOS
        ===============================

Option A: to install a pre-compiled program on an MS DOS system:
---------------------------------------------------------------

1. Download ltx2rt_e.zip and unpack it.

2. Put the executable (latex2rt.exe) to the directory where you 
   plan to run in, or to a directory that's listed in your PATH
   environment variable.

3. Put the configuration files (*.cfg) to the directory where you 
   plan to run latex2rtf, or to a directory that's listed in your
   RTFPATH environment variable. (Use MS DOS set command to set it).

4. Read user's guide in latex2rt.txt, or at least run
        latex2rt -?
   to see the list of options and argument order.


Option B: To compile the program for MS DOS system:
---------------------------------------------------

1. Either
   a. Uncompress and untar the tar file and download the files
       to your PC, 
   or
   b. Download and unpack the archive file "lat2rt_s.zip".

2. Edit the file "makefile.dos", as follows:

a. LIBDIR should indicate the directory where you plan to keep
   configuration files. (latex2rtf uses several *.cfg files. If you
   store them in "C:\latex2rt", set LIBDIR="c:\\\\latex2rt" (note
   quotes and 4 slashes); if you plan to always copy the cfg files to
   the directory where you are running latex2rtf, set LIBDIR=".".)

b. BININSTALL should be the name of the directory where you want to put
   the executable file, e.g.
        BININSTALL=c:\exe

c. If your C compiler and librarian have names other than tcc and tlib,
   replace the names where appropriate.

3. Run
        make -f makefile.dos

  You need Borland C compiler and librarian (e.g. tcc and tlib)
  to do the compilation.

4. Read user's guide in latex2rt.txt

5. Before using latex2rtf on a computer, make sure that you have copied
   the configuration files (*.cfg) to the directory specified in LIBDIR.
   Alternatively, you can set the MS DOS environment variable RTFPATH
   to point to the directory where the *.cfg files are, e.g.
   set RGFPATH=c:\lib\latex2rt

Note: The version of MS DOS I am using (6.20) allows using `/'
  in file names instead of `\\'. If your version does not allow
  this, you will have to replace the two occurence of `/' in
  "main.c" with `\\'.
