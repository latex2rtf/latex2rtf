This ist the file README.DOS of the LaTeX2rtf-converter, Version 1.8

The file L2R.BAT is for use with the Cygnus-Cygnwin32 generated
version of L2R.EXE.

The file L2R.EXE is precompiled for MS-DOS, it should run at least on
each DOS-computer with a 80386-CPU or higher. It does not work with
L2R.BAT.

This is all by now. Help yourself or ask.
