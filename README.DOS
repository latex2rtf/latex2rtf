The files L2R.BAT and L2RSEM.BAT 
are for use with the DJGPP generated version LATEX2RT.EXE.

The Unix and Mac distributions do not contain an executable for DOS / Windows.
Instead, get the DOS / Windows port as file latex2rtf-x.xx_dos.zip 
(where x.xx is the version number) from 

     http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/

To install latex2rtf, extract all files from the zip archive to C:\l2rt
 or to another folder (i.e. directory) of your choice,
preserving the folder structure (winzip: check "use folder names")
 If you extracted them to another folder,
 edit the files L2R.BAT and L2RSEM.BAT and change the pathes to latex2rt.exe 
 and to the cfg files to the folder where you put them.

Either make sure that
 the folder containing the executable latex2rt.exe is in your search path
 (e.g. adding to your autoexcec.bat: "PATH=...;...;C:\l2r")
or 
 at least put the files L2R.BAT, L2RSEM.BAT and into a folder
 which is in your search path.

If you want to use the option to convert equations to bitmaps (-M 12),
you must have TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript installed.
This works only on win32 systems (win95, win98, winNT4, win2000, winXP)
because ImageMagick is available only for win32, not for pure DOS.
Of TeX, you need a complete installation.
Of ImageMagick, get the version for Win2000, it will also work under win95 and win98.
   You only need convert.exe.
Of Ghostscript, you only need gswin32c.exe and gsdll32.dll.
Either the folders where TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed
must be in your search path, or you must edit the file LATEX2PNG.BAT 
and specify the folders where TeX, ImageMagick and Ghostscript are installed
in the SET commands, e.g.
...
rem Set path to latex here (ending with \) if it isn't in your search path:
SET TEXDIR=C:\texmf\miktex\bin\

rem Set path to ImageMagick's convert here (ending with \) if it isn't in your search path:
SET MAGICKDIR=C:\ImageMagick\

rem Set path to Ghostscript's gswin32c.exe here if it isn't in your search path:
SET GSDIR=C:\Aladdin\gs6.01\bin


Starting the conversion:
------------------------
Best, copy the file(s) to be converted into an empty folder. 
cd to this folder.
Start conversion by calling l2r.bat (without -S option)
or l2rsem.bat (with -S option).
Whether you must use the -S option depends on the windows system
in which the resulting rtf file will be opened ("target system").
In the target system, check 
"Start - Settings - Control Panel" ("Start - Einstellungen - Systemsteuerung")
and open "country settings" ("Ländereinstellungen").
Click the tab "numbers" ("Zahlen"). 
The last entry in this menu is "list separator" ("Listentrennzeichen").
This is either a comma or a semicolon.
If it's a comma (default for English versions of Windows), 
call latex2rt without -S parameter.
If it's a semicolon (default for German versions of Windows), 
call latex2rt with -S parameter.
Sorry, I don't know what the defaults are for other countries.
