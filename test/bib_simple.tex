This is a citation for which the citation should be known \cite{known}.
We follow this with an unknown citation \cite{unknown}.

To test various combinations we need to cite more than one author.  To this
end, I cite two known authors \cite{known,known2}.  This might include one
known and one unknown \cite{unknown,known}.  Another bizarre case might be
one known, one unknown and another known \cite{known,unknown,known2}.
