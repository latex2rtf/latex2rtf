This is an equation environment in which to test fractions.  Not great translation
but at least some.   This uses \verb#\frac#
$$
\frac{1}{2} = \frac{\alpha+\beta}{\gamma+\delta}

Now I will test the square root.  First a simple square root
$$
z = \sqrt{x+y}
$$
now something a bit harder
$$
z = \sqrt{x^2+y^2}
$$
and what the heck, lets put a square root together with a fraction
$$
z = \frac{1}{\sqrt{x+y}}
$$

Now for some integrals.  How about a somewhat complicated one to start
$$
\int_{0}^{\infty} \frac{a}{\sqrt{x^2+c}}\,dx
$$
and
$$
\int_0^\infty \frac{a}{\sqrt{x^2+c}}\,dx
$$
$$
\sum_0^\infty \frac{a}{\sqrt{x^2+c}}\,dx
$$
$$
\prod_0^\infty \frac{a}{\sqrt{x^2+c}}\,dx
$$
