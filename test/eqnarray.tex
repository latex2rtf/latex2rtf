Here the equation array is being tested.  This equation has no equation number
and is about as simple as an equation array can get.
\begin{eqnarray*}
z & = & w + x + \\
  &   & 5w - 8c 
\end{eqnarray*}

Here the equation array is being tested.  This equation the first and third equations numbered
\begin{eqnarray}
z & = & w + x  \\
z & = & w + x \nonumber\\
z & = & w + x  
\end{eqnarray}

Here the equation array is being tested.  This checks for a bug when 
\verb#\nonumber# is present in an \verb#\begin{eqnarray*}# environment.  
This equation the first and third equations numbered
\begin{eqnarray*}
z & = & w + x  \\
z & = & w + x \nonumber\\
z & = & w + x  
\end{eqnarray*}
