To install (on a UNIX system)
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration.  The default install
  is reasonable, but if you do not have root access, then you might
  need to set $DESTDIR to be your home directory.
- make
- If this is not your first-time installation, you may want to preserve
  your old configuration (*.cfg) files. Copy them to a safe place before
  installing.
- make check   (expect warnings but no errors)
- make install
