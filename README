latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by several textprocessors, including Microsoft Word and
Word for Windows. It was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer
in a one-semester course in our department. For the Copyright of the
Program see the file Copyright.

To install (on a UNIX system)
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration. The install part supports
  multiple directories to install to, you will normally only need one.
  Be sure to correctly configure the LIBDIR variable to the directory
  where support files (ending in .cfg) will be found by the program.
  This is normally the same as the LIBINSTALL variable.
- make
- make install
- If you have problems with make install (for example if your mkdir
  doesn't support the -p option) and you do not need multiple install
  targets, try:
  make simple_install
- If this is not your first-time installation, you may want to preserve
  you configuration (*.cfg) files. Copy them to a safe place and issue
  the command
  make install_and_delete_old_cfg
  (If you have problems with mkdir or other problems as above, use the
  make-target "simple_cfg_install")
- Try the program and report any errors to the address below.

On an MS DOS system:
- Uncompress and untar the tar file.
- Download all the files to your DOS machine, to the directory
  where you plan to keep the source code and the configuration files.
- Edit the file "makefile.dos", setting LIBDIR to be your source
  directory (note quotes and 4 slashes), and BININSTALL to be
  the name of the directory where you want to put the executable
  file.
- Run
        make -f makefile.dos
  You need Borland C compiler and librarian (e.g. tcc and tlib)
  to do this.

Note 1: The configuration files (*.cfg) are not copied or
  moved anywhere. They stay in the source directory. Therefore, you
  should not remove the source directory.

Note 2: The version of MS DOS I am using (6.20) allows using `/'
  in file names instead of `\\'. If your version does not allow
  this, you will have to replace the two occurence of "/" in
  "main.c" with "\\".

The MS DOS adaptation is by Vladimir Menkov, vmenkov@cs.indiana.edu.
