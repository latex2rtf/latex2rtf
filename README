latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by several textprocessors, including Microsoft Word
and Word for Windows.  

latex2rtf began as a program written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer 
in a one-semester course.  This program was later updated in another 
one-semester course by Friedrich Polzer and Gerhard Trisko.  Ralf Schlatterbeck 
<ralf@zoo.priv.at> maintained and extended it until 1998.  The current maintainer 
is Georg Lehner <jorge_lehner@gmx.net>.  Many changes were submitted by Scott
Prahl <prahl@ece.ogi.edu> during 2001.  

For the Copyright of the Program see the file Copyright.

The documentation of the program is found in the doc/ directory in the
file latex2rtf.info in the GNU info format.  For your convenience find
a HTML and a PDF version of the manual there.

To install (on a UNIX system)
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration. The install part supports
  multiple directories to install to, you will normally only need one.
  Be sure to correctly configure the LIBDIR variable to the directory
  where support files (ending in .cfg) will be found by the program.
  This is normally the same as the LIBINSTALL variable.
- make
- If this is not your first-time installation, you may want to preserve
  your old configuration (*.cfg) files. Copy them to a safe place before
  installing.
- make install
- If you have problems with make install (for example if your mkdir
  doesn't support the -p option) and you do not need multiple install
  targets, try:
  make simple_install
- Define the environment variable RTFPATH this is typically /usr/local/lib/latex2rtf
- Run make test to test your installation

Reporting bugs:
Please give the following information and observe the following
guidelines when reporting a bug in the program to the homepage
at Sourceforge
              http://sourceforge.net/projects/latex2rtf/

* Try the most recent version of the program, this is especially 
  important when the code is getting updated frequently.
* Give the version of the program
  - For the executable you get the version by specifying the -V option
    to latex2rtf
  - For the sources the version is the version number of the file
    version.h
* The Operating System and version number where you are running or
  trying to install latex2rtf. Be sure to check the file Makefile for
  settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some
  versions of SunOS there may be settings which are needed to compile
  successfully. Do this BEFORE submitting the bug reports.
* If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include
  a SHORT latex file along with a description of the problem. It is 
  imperative that you spend time isolating the problem into a small
  latex file.  This shows that you actually care enough about the 
  problem to spend some of your time trying to help isolate the bug.
* Be patient.  We maintain the program in our free time and we did
  not write most of the code.  We will try to fix reported bugs
  in upcoming releases.
