latex2rtf is a translator program that translates LaTeX text into the
RTF format used by several textprocessors, including Microsoft Word and
Word for Windows. It was written by Fernando Dorner and Andreas Granzer
in a one-semester course in our department. For the Copyright of the
Program see the file Copyright.

To install
- Edit Makefile for your local configuration. The install part supports
  multiple directories to install to, you will normally only need one.
  Be sure to correctly configure the LIBDIR variable to the directory
  where support files (ending in .cfg) will be found by the program.
  This is normally the same as the LIBINSTALL variable.
- make
- make install
- If you have problems with make install (for example if your mkdir
  doesn't support the -p option) and you do not need multiple install
  targets, try:
  make simple_install
- Try the program and report any errors to the address below.
