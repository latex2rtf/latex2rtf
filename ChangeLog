r840 SP: Fixes for alignment of displayed equations when the equations are converted to bitmaps.
         Vertical spacing can be poor, but now the equation numbers are in the right places.  Numbering of
         bitmap equations is much better (especially when the equations should not be numbered).

r841 SP: Tagging release version of 1.9.19

r842 SP: Modify version number.  First check-in for 1.9.20

r843 WH: documentation: updated Win32 section.

r844 SP: Fix for bug when converting large latex images to bitmaps.

r845 SP: Eliminate the unnecessary loop in PutLatexFile()

r846 SP: Have tables be converted using the figure_scale and not the equation_scale.

r847 SP: Trivial revisions to WriteLatexAsBitmap() for clarity.

r850 SP: add my_strlcat() and my_strlcpy() to utils.h for later use.

r851 SP: update Makefile with hints from the Gentoo porter Alexis Ballier..
         Move the -lm to LIBS and replace LINK_FLAGS by LDFLAGS
         for linker flags which is set in the environment. The -lm needs to be
         in LIBS otherwise it'll fail with --as-needed as linker flag.
         The other part is just to allow taking CFLAGS from the environment so
         that people are free to use the optimisations they want.
         Regenerate the build file dependencies

r852 SP: eliminate strcat() in favor of strlcat()

r853 SP: Replace many uses of strcpy() with my_strlcpy()

r854 SP: Modifications from the NetBSD patch

r855 WH: first try to get styles working correctly:
         preamble.c, write out normal style:
         use "DefaultFontSize()" instead of "CurrentFontSize()" -- works.
         vertical.c, write out normal paragraph:
         include \fs with CurrentFontSize() -- works, but still writes out wrong size

r856 SP: Replace '\page{}' with '\page\par ' so that the style for the pagebreak will be correct.
         Add head_report.tex to the default testing list.

r857 SP: First attempt at turning the style machinery on.  Pretty much everything is broken now, but
         a lot of the problems can probably be fixed by expanding the definitions in style.cfg.

r858 WH: Defined more styles in style.cfg.
         Significant changes in vertical.c:
         "startParagraph()" now also issues a \plain to reset character formatting, and
         removed CurrentFontSize() because this is already written in "InsertStyle()".
         Minor changes in preamble.c and xrefs.c:
         removed "InsertStyle()" because already called from "startParagraph()"
         Remaining problem:
         "InsertStyle()" still inserts wrong font name when style contains *Typewriter*

r859 SP: Improve the rtf header so that the \fonttbl{} and {\stylesheet ...} appear as in style.cfg.
         This has been annoying for a very long time.

r860 SP: Add *CurrentFontSize* and *DefaultFontSize* as possible entries in styles.cfg.  This allows
         us to avoid hard-coding the font size in the style.cfg file.

r861 SP: Lot of debugging stuff to figure out why TexFontNumber() fails to work properly.

r862 SP: alter the 'make test' behavior

r863 SP: Fix error in font number lookup.

r864 WH: Modified styles in style.cfg so that "toc n" is set in default size.
         Removed extra code from CmdVerbatim() so that verbatim paragraphs get the associated style.

r865 SP: add SearchCfgEntryByID() and fix regression in handling of cyrillic and latin2 encodings.

r866 SP: remove extraneous diagnostic information.  Eliminate compiler warning.

r867 SP: improve styles for the abstract environment

r868 WH: Added styles for "tabular" and "quote"

r869 SP: Basic functions to manipulate and query the current style.

r870 SP: Fix for '\begin  {   environ}'  Note this fails when spaces come at the end

r871 SP: support \linewidth (will not work properly in two-column mode)

r872 SP: Properly close PNG files when reading the header fails.  This resolves the "too many opne
         files problem when converting long documents with equations using -M12.

r873 SP: Minimize debugging info when using -M12

r874 SP: Another trivial formatting tweak to 'Rendering' message

r875 WH: in dutch.cfg, changed "y to ij (alternatively textijlig)
         following discussion on comp.text.tex at Jan. 21-22, 2008.
         Added definitions for \textijlig to direct.cfg.

r876 SP: Fix double period in et al.. when apacite is used.  Add placeholders for apa_section and
         friends.

r877 SP: fix some issues with the apa.cls

r878 WH: added support for Euro sign in latin9 encoding (needed by LyX)
         and added the Euro sign to test files enc_cp1250.tex and enc_latin9.tex

r879 WH: fixed: normal text paragraph following heading was formatted in heading style
         although the paragraph correctly had the normal style assigned.
         Fixing this required some braces {} to be added to the rtf output.

r880 SP: add comment

r881 SP: Changes to make sure that paragraphs get handled in a uniform manner.
         Add new styles for equations.  Begin to separate out the use of \field
         in RTF output.  All files in the test directory are converted to rtf,
         but the output is still wrong.  More work is needed, but at least now
         all the files are converted with balanced braces.

r882 SP: add missing files

r883 SP: make the emitted RTF for tables more readable

r884 SP: clean up RTF output for newpages.

r885 SP: Eliminate weird spacing for french quotes <<

         the code works

r893 SP: fix bash location and linefeeds in this script

r894 WH: added "dirinfo" entry to latex2rtf.texi (patch ID 2461905)

r895 SP: get basic character support working again.  These changes get
         accentchars.tex, oddchars.tex unicode.tex and overstrike.tex
         working again ... at least with Microsoft Word 2004 on a Mac.

r896 SP: Fix crash in tabular with some types of files
         add infrastructure to improve setting column widths
right now the widths are just evenly distributed

         initialize variables to avoid warnings
         define HAS_STRDUP on unix machines

         more fixes for the acronym package

r909 SP: test files for acronym package

r910 SP: basic implementation of /newif by by Yoshihiro Ota.
         1. a \newif command registers a new condition name.
         2. The registered names are tested with TryConditionSet() function.
         3. \else and \if commands are added to handle conditions.
         4. Nested conditions are also supported.
