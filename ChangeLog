1.9e
        Revised all the accented character code using ideas borrowed from ltx2rtf.  
        Comparing ltx2rtf and latex2rtf indicates that Taupin and Lehner tended to work on
        different areas of the latex->rtf conversion process.  Adding
        accented characters is the first step in the merging process.

        Added MacRoman font handling (primarily to get the breve accent)   
        Now supports a wide variety of accented characters.
        (compound characters only work under more recent versions of word)
        Reworked the code to change font sizes.
        Added latex logo code from ltx2rtf
        Extracted character code into separate file chars.c
        Fixed bug with \sf reverting to roman
        Added two new testing files fontsize.tex and accentchars.tex
        
1.9d
        Rewrote the \cite code.
        No crashes when .aux missing.
        Inserts '?' for unknown citations
        Added cite.tex and cite.bib to for testing \cite commands
        hyperref not tested since I don't use it.
        A small hyperref test file would be nice
        Revised treatment of \oe and \OE per Wilfried Hennings suggestions
        Added support for MT Extra in direct.cfg and fonts.cfg so that
        more math characters will be translated e.g., \ell (see oddchars.tex)
        added and improved font changing commands e.g., \texttt, \it

1.9c
	Added support for \frac
	Complete support for all characters in the symbol font now
	Better support for unusual ansi characters (e.g., \dag and \ddag)
	Gave direct.cfg a spring cleaning
	Added support for \~n and \~N 
	New file oddchars.tex for testing many of these translations.
	New file frac.tex to test \frac and \over
