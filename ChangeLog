r752 support \symbol{\'23} and \symbol{\"13}.  Improve \char'23 so that
     it changes if\tt is active

r753 support \char92 and \char`b and \symbol{92}

r754 rip out support for %latex2rtf: as a way of controlling parser. 
     Replace uses in examples with \iflatex2rtf ... \else ... \fi.  Fix
     mistake in getSimpleCommand() that did not allow '\!' to be
     returned. Eliminate weird bug when a command follows an integral
     sign ... $\int \cos$. Improve debugging output at -d2 level.

r755 Do not try to ignore packages or package options.

r756 Fixes for the regressions in overstrike.tex

r757 WH: commented out unneeded 'show_buffer' function in preparse.c

r758 add \urlstyle{} ignore.cfg.  Cleaned up TryIgnoreVariable().  Made
     arguments to strdup_together be constant strings.  More of this
     should be done.

r759 silence \renewcommand{}{} warning.

r760 no functional change ... just different code comment

r762 Improve documentation for \iflatextortf and provide work-around for
     %latex2rtf:

r763 Fix for backslash-linefeed problem in .aux files.  Pretty obscure.

r764 Suppress multiple warnings for missing \bibcite{} entries.  Change
     Makefile in test directory to sup press all the output from latex.

r765 WH: modified cfg.c so that latex2rtf also tries to find the cfg dir
     in C:\%ProgramFiles%\latex2rtf\cfg (default if installed by windows
     installer)

r766 Fix typo in diagnotic message for \ensureeqn.  Fix Makefile for
     bib_super.tex. Revise my_fgetc() in the hopes of making it more
     portable.  Update ScanBbl() so that it uses the new routine.

r767 Fix regressions in bib_natbib1.tex and bib_natbib2.tex.  Don't know
     where this code went, but the use of plain old \cite{} in the
     natbib style was broken.

r768 Add tests for \documentclass{apa}

r769 Make section headers bold for \documentclass{apa}

r770 Fix the bug from the preamble of bib_apa.  Add 'const' to more
     functions. Eliminate all unneeded fprintf(stderr,...).  Rename a
     bunch of diagnostic(1,...) instances to diagnostic(WARNING, ...).

r771 Adding two more test files

r772 WH: Modified main.c so that -P option now works also under
     DOS/Windows. Updated documentation of -P option and -M option.
     Fixed bug in latex2png script.

r773 WH: Updated documentation of -P option and -M option (again).

r774 added diagnostic() line to my_fgets() to help sort out the problems
     on Windows.

r775 WH: xrefs.c: Open aux file in binary mode. Removed extra
     diagnostic() line.

r776 Use fprintf() in show_string() to produce better diagnostics

r777 Fix for bibentry_apalike.tex

r778 Make sure all fopen() calls use the mode "rb"

r779 Starting the process of rationalizing the debug levels

r780 remove a few instances of strcat

r781 More clean-up of debugging information.  -d2 now shows nothing but
     file manipulations.  Small tweaks to makefile in the test directory
     to create temporary files in a folder within the current directory.

r782 More diagnostics clean-up.  It is now possible to get relatively
     noise-free output using -d2.  This diagnostic level shows file
     handling and each section as it is handled.  The plan is to make
     -d3 echo system commands and each section as it is preparsed.  -d4
     will track each \command as it is used.

r783 More rationalization for debugging levels.  One day -d5 will be
     stuff that happens within CmdName() functions and -d6 will show
     nearly everything but character processing, and -d7 will show each
     character as it gets read and processed.

r784 Fix for fig_endfloat conversion.  It mostly works.  A few more
     diagnostic() tweaks.

r785 More diagnostics() tweaks.

r786 support \overrightarrow

r787 preliminary support for subfigure package

r788 test file for \subfigure[caption]{figure} command

r789 Add proper paragraph ending to subfigure pieces.  Fix numbering of
     subfigures.  Add tests.

r790 Initial code to support the pstricks-add package.  Three commands
     are recognized \psset{}, \begin{psgraph}, and \begin{pspicture}. 
     One broken test file (at least I cannot latex it successfully) is
     also included.

r791 Emit information as latex2rtf is doing slow stuff (converting
     latex->PNG or pdf->PNG).  Eliminate first linefeed and emit a final
     linefeed when done.  This helps to group the output with the
     previous command.

r792 Clean up a few preamble problems in the test documents.

r793 revert to placing the DOCUMENT_MODE environment before PREAMBLE
     because there was no real reason to change and this might introduce
     new subtle bugs.

r794 add support for \href{url}{text}, \url{url}, \nolinkurl{url}.

r795 start of a test file for hyperref features

r796 refactoring the hyperlink code

r797 more \url{ref} clean-up.  add putRtfStrEscaped() function.

r798 eliminate some compiler warnings

r799 Minor change to getRawTexChar() to handle EOF condition better. 
     Small change to CmdInclude() to properly terminate with long file
     names.

r800 Make is so that long file names fail properly when \input is used. 
     Extend the possible file name length to 99.

r801 Fix bug in ScanAux() so that it handles \@input{file} properly. 
     Enhance test/include.tex so that it can be properly processed by
     latex.  Add pagebreak before every instance of \include{file} as
     should be done.  Fix minor bug in subsubsection numbering when
     section but not subsection is used.

r802 preliminary code to support \newpsstyle{}{} ... unclear if it works
     yet.

r803 remove debugging commands since \newpsstyle{}{} seems to work.  Add
     more packages with 'limited' support.  Have a number of test files
     run latex first to generate .aux files.  Improve diagnostics for
     writelatexasbitmap().

r804 silently ignore \nobreak, \expandafter, \long.  Change warnings
     from 'ignored' to 'unknown'.  More general cleanup.

r805 WH: fixed a bug in main.c. Updated documentation.

r806 WH: fixed my bugfix in main.c (should have tested it before
     uploading!)

r807 Minor clean-up of -se# and -sf# scaling options.  We don't properly
     support long option names, currently '-se #' is an error.

r808 support for \urlstyle{}

r809 support \UrlFont{}

r810 support for \nameref{}

r811 add missing .bib file to tarball.  Update changelog.

r812 Improve \nolinkurl{} so that it typesets correctly and works with
	'%' in the url. Fix long-standing issue with user-defined
	environments and scope.  Modify unknown command message...again.

r813 Put \- hyphenation command back in. Originally removed before I
	realised the problem was with OOwriter, not with rtf generally. It
	appears to work fine with MSWord.

r814 Increased the stack from 2000 to 10000. This was motivated by the
	failure of longstack.tex to parse properly. The increased stack size
	fixes this for now, but I suspect there is a problem with the stack
	not getting emptied.

r815 Evidently url.sty and hyperref.sty work differently.  Implement
	accordingly.  Revert linux.tex to use the url.sty package and let
	hyperref.tex test the hyperref package.

r816 WH: Updated documentation reflecting successful testing under
	Vista.

r817 Attempting to revert r816

r818 Add Wilfried's changes from r816

r819 WH: documentation: Tables section (-t2 option) and editorial
	changes. main.c: added handling of option -V (uppercase)

r820 add test/longstack.tex to tarball and to the test suite

r821 Fix for missing paragraph break for a \url{} that starts a new
	paragraph.

r822 Change how \, is translated.  Make it a small non-breaking space
	instead of a just a small space.

r823 CmdNoBreak() was so good it turned out that it was already in the
	codebase as CmdNonBreak().  Eliminated duplicate routine.  Added
	support for \thinspace

r824 Use \charscalex instad of \fs to change the size of a non-breaking
	space.
