	Rewrote paragraph handling
	completely.  Far fewer bugs in indentation of paragraphs.  Support
	for \indent and \noindent.  Infrastructure support to handle \vskip
	and \vspace.  Added reasonable hanging indent for bibliographies. 
	All test files now have matching opening and closing braces in the
	created RTF files.  Fixed bugs for \chapter.  Eliminated a handful
	of global variables.  Added five extra closing braces at the end of
	RTF files so that mistranslated files will still open in Word.

2001-09-18 22:06  prahl

	Fixed brace bug in
	equations.  Fixed tabbing in equations.  Fixed alignment of
	equation numbers Typeset equation numbers in roman. Add bracecheck
	utility --- all rtf files should have level zero

2001-09-17 22:20  prahl

	Fixed bug in IgnoreEnvironment Fixed bug in
	IgnoreParameter Added feature! insert \verbositylevel{5} in a LaTeX
	document and dynamically increase the verbosity of debugging
	output.  Of course the 5 can be replaced by any number from 0 to 6

2001-09-17 20:40  prahl

	Default alignment
	is once again justified Fixed bug with \mbox{} Fixed bug with
	\footnote{} Added support for german language Some support for
	french

2001-09-16 09:33  prahl

	Fixed bug in RTF output for papesize.  Added support
	for b5paper, a5paper Enhanced support for all page sizes

2001-09-15 22:11  prahl

	Gave up and completely revised font
	handling.  latex2rtf now uses an output filter to keep track of the
	brace level and font changes in the RTF file.  This allows \emph to
	be handled properly.  This will also allow digits to be typeset
	upright in math mode, but this has not been implemented yet.

2001-09-09 22:40  prahl

	
	Eliminated many mysterious spaces that crept into the RTF file
	Added braces to localize the effects of environments There are
	still problems with identifying the current font when environments
	are closed.   This is probably insoluble give the current
	constraints on the problem.  Added align.tex to test the center,
	flushright, and flushleft environments

2001-09-09 20:14  prahl

	Fixed \sffamily and others Forced \plain in
	verb environments Eliminated extra document environment

2001-09-09 12:43  prahl

	added fancy.tex to test
	simple header commands

2001-09-09 12:41  prahl

	Added support for
	\cfoot \lfoot \rfoot \chead \lhead \rhead

2001-09-05 21:43  prahl

	separated convert
	routines into convert.c separated bibliographic routines into
	biblio.c separated tabular and tabbing routines into tables.c
	eliminated funct2 by merging routines with funct1 moved ignore
	routines to ignore.c Improved support for \emph and \em Problems
	still remain with test files misc3 and misc4

2001-08-23 07:26  prahl

	Just cleaning up the header for funct2.c.

2001-08-22 22:35  prahl

	Yet more changes to font
	handling.  Added \upshape \textup and \begin{upshape} Added
	\begin{Verbatim} as well as \Frac.  Tried to add \prod and \sum,
	but these don't yet work.  Seems that there are problems with
	processing frac.tex.  These will be worked on.

2001-08-21 22:50  prahl

	More improvements in handling of font
	family, shape, series, and size.  LaTeX2RTF infrastructure now
	mimicks the LaTeX view of fonts.  This check-in fixes problems with
	fonts.tex and fontsize.tex.  It also adds support for \em, \emph,
	and \begin{em}...\end{em}.  Support for the relatively unusual
	\begin{itshape}...\end{itshape} and others is also included.
	
	Problems remain with misc3.tex and misc4.tex

2001-08-19 18:12  prahl

	Fixed subtle bug in
	ConvertString().  This was the real cause of the last problem with
	fonts.tex.  Basically, ConvertString() called Convert() only once,
	however if the string contained any open/close brace pairs e.g.,
	'the {\it italic} string' then everything after the closing brace
	would be discarded.
	
	I also fixed a problem with discarding the first space sent to
	Convert().
	
	The fix to ConvertString() and the initial space conversion require
	some careful testing.

2001-08-19 17:02  prahl

	Fixed problem with
	processing fonts.tex Added support for a variety French
	abbreviations

2001-08-12 16:39  prahl

	1.9e	     Revised all the accented character
	code using ideas borrowed from ltx2rtf. 	 Comparing ltx2rtf
	and latex2rtf indicates that Taupin and Lehner tended to work on   
	      different areas of the latex->rtf conversion process.  Adding
		 accented characters is the first step in the merging
	process.
	
		Added MacRoman font handling (primarily to get the breve
	accent)
		Now supports a wide variety of accented characters.
		(compound characters only work under more recent versions
	of word)
		Reworked the code to change font sizes.
		Added latex logo code from ltx2rtf
		Extracted character code into separate file chars.c
		Fixed bug with \sf reverting to roman
		Added two new testing files fontsize.tex and
	accentchars.tex

	hyperref not tested since I don't use it.	   A small hyperref
	test file would be nice 	 Revised treatment of \oe and \OE
	per Wilfried Hennings suggestions	   Added support for MT
	Extra in direct.cfg and fonts.cfg so that	   more math
	characters will be translated e.g., \ell (see oddchars.tex)	   
	 added and improved font changing commands e.g., \texttt, \it
