	This needs more work also
	Modified the way that getParam works, does not *seem* to have busted
	anything.
	
	2001-10-10 21:27  prahl
	
	added \Upsilon \varepsilon \varrho \L and \l to direct.cfg
	(only the first has a real translation).  I decided that the epsilon
	in the Symbol font was just like \varepsilon and so now \varepsilon
	maps to the epsilon in the Symbol font and \epsilon -> [epsilon]
	added encoding_tables.h to the Makefile
	moved \hoffset and friends to the preamble commands
	fixed a factor of two bug in getDimension

	2001-09-25 22:34  prahl
	
	Updated changelog.  Added box.tex as test file.  Updated ToDo
	Updated version.h to 1.9i.  Modified Makefile to not use -Wall
	This is the last check-in before 1.9i tarball is released.
	
	2001-09-25 20:31  prahl
	
	Rewrote paragraph handling completely.  Far fewer bugs in indentation
	of paragraphs.  Support for \indent and \noindent.  Infrastructure
	support to handle \vskip and \vspace.  Added reasonable hanging indent
	for bibliographies.  All test files now have matching opening and

	2001-09-16 09:33  prahl

	Added support for b5paper, a5paper
	Enhanced support for all page sizes
	
	2001-09-15 22:11  prahl
	
	Gave up and completely revised font handling.  latex2rtf now uses an output
	filter to keep track of the brace level and font changes in the RTF file.
	This allows \emph to be handled properly.  This will also allow digits to
	be typeset upright in math mode, but this has not been implemented yet.
	
	2001-09-09 22:40  prahl
	
	Eliminated many mysterious spaces that crept into the RTF file
	Added braces to localize the effects of environments
	There are still problems with identifying the current font when
	environments are closed.   This is probably insoluble give the
	current constraints on the problem.
	Added align.tex to test the center, flushright, and flushleft environments
	
	2001-09-09 20:14  prahl
	
	Fixed \sffamily and others
	Forced \plain in verb environments

	2001-08-23 07:26  prahl
	
	Just cleaning up the header for funct2.c.
	
	2001-08-22 22:35  prahl
	
	Yet more changes to font handling.  Added \upshape \textup and \begin{upshape}
	Added \begin{Verbatim} as well as \Frac.  Tried to add \prod and \sum,
	but these don't yet work.  Seems that there are problems with processing
	frac.tex.  These will be worked on.
	
	2001-08-21 22:50  prahl
	
	More improvements in handling of font family, shape, series, and size.
	LaTeX2RTF infrastructure now mimicks the LaTeX view of fonts.  This
	check-in fixes problems with fonts.tex and fontsize.tex.  It also adds
	support for \em, \emph, and \begin{em}...\end{em}.  Support for the
	relatively unusual \begin{itshape}...\end{itshape} and others is also
	included.
	
	Problems remain with misc3.tex and misc4.tex
	
	2001-08-19 18:12  prahl
	
	Fixed subtle bug in ConvertString().  This was the real cause of the last
	problem with fonts.tex.  Basically, ConvertString() called Convert() only
	once, however if the string contained any open/close brace pairs e.g.,
	'the {\it italic} string' then everything after the closing brace would
	be discarded.
	
	I also fixed a problem with discarding the first space sent to Convert().
	
	The fix to ConvertString() and the initial space conversion require some
	careful testing.
	
	2001-08-19 17:02  prahl
	
	Fixed problem with processing fonts.tex
	Added support for a variety French abbreviations

	1.9e
			Revised all the accented character code using ideas borrowed from ltx2rtf.
			Comparing ltx2rtf and latex2rtf indicates that Taupin and Lehner tended to work on
			different areas of the latex->rtf conversion process.  Adding
			accented characters is the first step in the merging process.
	
			Added MacRoman font handling (primarily to get the breve accent)
			Now supports a wide variety of accented characters.
			(compound characters only work under more recent versions of word)
			Reworked the code to change font sizes.
			Added latex logo code from ltx2rtf
			Extracted character code into separate file chars.c
			Fixed bug with \sf reverting to roman
			Added two new testing files fontsize.tex and accentchars.tex

			added and improved font changing commands e.g., \texttt, \it
