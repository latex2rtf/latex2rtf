    Fix pointers in .texi file 

  2007-09-15 22:38:04 (r654)

    Tolerate \begin{small} ... \end{small} 

  2007-09-15 22:21:50 (r653)

    Stop reading the latex file when \end{document} is encountered. This
    should facilitate tracking down bugs as well as being the right thing
    to do. 

  2007-09-15 19:54:25 (r652)

    Removed unused fonts from fonts.cfg. The extra Roman fonts were not
    used anywhere. I recently removed every instance of 'Lucida Sans
    Unicode' from direct.cfg. I had two reasons. First, it should be up
    to the RTF reader to find a font with a particular unicode feature.
    For example, if the default font is 'Times' and the reader encounters
    {\u376Y} 'LATIN CAPITAL LETTER Y WITH CIRCUMFLEX', then it should try
    to construct the character in the Times font. If this fails, then it
    should look in some default unicode font and use that character. The
    second reason is that 'Lucida Sans Unicode' is Windows centric and
    the font does not exist on MacOS X or Linux. If this causes problems,
    I will revert this change.

  2007-09-15 18:37:14 (r651)

    Add support for \dots, eliminate duplicate entry for \ldots 

  2007-09-15 18:19:20 (r650)

    Include optional text in all \cite[text]{key} constructions. Reported
    in the debian distribution by Karim Belabas
    <karim.belabas@math.u-bordeaux.fr>. 

  2007-09-14 00:36:40 (r649)

    Adding text/geotest.tex 

  2007-09-13 12:54:27 (r648)

    Support for \doublespacing option. Basic, but seems to work. 

  2007-09-05 11:15:53 (r647)

    Support for emitting raw latex into file so that it can be converted
    using the new version 6 MathType. Experimental at the moment.
    Equations are emitted as <<:$x+y$:>> for example. 

  2007-09-05 10:53:31 (r646)

    Reverse the default behavior for the '-p' switch. Word seems to work
    better when parentheses are not properly escaped. 

  2007-08-31 18:27:55 (r645)

    Fix bug in eps_to_png where the new filename terminated too soon. 

  2007-08-31 16:31:18 (r644)

    WH: changed size calculation in graphics.c back to previous version
    but added -units parameter to calls to ImageMagick convert, also in
    scripts. In graphics.c, changed call to gs (doesn't work in WinXP) to
    ImgMag convert. 

  2007-08-30 14:21:31 (r643)

    WH: changed graphics.c: resolution read from png is pix per inch, not
    per meter, at least under WinXP, and with the 2002 version of netpbm.
    Graphics and equations now scale correctly in my Word 2003. Please
    install and test under other systems! 

  2007-08-29 14:57:34 (r642)

    WH: restored a line in latex2png script because $name.pbm is read by
    latex2rtf and added the corresponding line to latex2pn.bat.
    Nevertheless graphics sizes are still not as they should be. 

  2007-08-28 19:34:30 (r641)

    Remove unneeded Lucida Unicode Sans from direct.cfg. There is no need
    to use a special font for the unicode sequences. In fact, it is wrong
    when the current font has the unicode character, but there is a
    forced font change to Lucida Unicode. 

  2007-08-28 19:18:40 (r640)

    Remove hack from direct.c to support symbol font. Slightly modify
    comment in direct.cfg 

  2007-08-28 19:14:14 (r639)

    Remove all uses of the symbol font from direct.cfg. This should allow
    characters with symbols to be properly handled in equation fields by
    directly calling CmdSymbolChar(). 

  2007-08-28 10:55:22 (r638)

    WH: inserted the changes from latex2png script into latex2pn.bat and
    removed a do-nothing command from latex2png script 

  2007-08-27 20:43:51 (r637)

    Restore baseline positioning for PNG files so that it works again.
    'latex2rtf -M12 test/eqns2' now works as it should. 

  2007-08-27 16:50:00 (r636)

    Replace PushSource(); getDimension(); PopSource() with
    getStringDimension() throughout the source code. This fixed at least
    one bug in preamble.c and simplifies code several other places. 

  2007-08-27 00:33:37 (r635)

    Re-enable deletion of intermediate files. 

  2007-08-27 00:32:23 (r634)

    Massive rewrite of graphics emission. Better probing of png file for
    resolution. Better documentation about how the values for \pichgoal
    and \pich are calculated. Now using the keyvalue routine from util.c
    to improve handling of graphics options. The upshot is that figures
    are scaled properly now. Ironically, I needed to know the resolution
    of the png file only to know if it was bogus. If it was bad then the
    image must be scaled. If not, then Word seems to do the right thing. 

  2007-08-26 05:37:04 (r633)

    Remove unneeded debugging information 

  2007-08-26 05:36:11 (r632)

    Fix psfig crasher that Wilfried found. It was a pretty silly error...
    I wrote 'filename' and not 'figure'. 

  2007-08-26 04:55:55 (r631)

    add patch submitted in Feb 2006 by Steve Schwartz that fixes a bug in
    the bitmapped equation cropping. Results look pretty good. 

  2007-08-25 22:18:08 (r630)

    Fix, well sorta, the problems with eqns2.tex. First problem was that
    Word has a bug associated with commas in an array. I cannot figure
    out how to escape a comma properly, so I just put in a semicolon. The
    second bug was that a \par token was emitted within an equation
    field. Added a bit of logic to prevent this from happening. 

  2007-08-25 20:54:26 (r629)

    Use the minus sign in the symbol font for '-' in equations. This is
    both typographically correct, and equations convert properly when
    clicked to convert to equation editor. 

  2007-08-25 20:37:58 (r628)

    support ,, as a synonym for \quotedblbase. 

  2007-08-23 23:48:04 (r627)

    Removed redundant debugging commands.

  2007-08-23 20:57:05 (r626)

    plug a memory leak.

    comment out debugging stuff that I added 

  2007-08-23 17:55:13 (r624)

    Added missing PopSource() to handling of geometry options. Whitespace
    fixes. 

  2007-08-22 04:23:58 (r623)

    All use of the symbol font goes through CmdSymbolChar() now 

  2007-08-22 00:03:52 (r622)

    Starting work on fixing all the problems with image files. First set
    of changes. Nothing is really fixed yet. 

  2007-08-21 22:36:29 (r621)

    fix bug in handling of \begin{table*} ... \end{table*}. 

  2007-08-21 22:17:25 (r620)

    fix bug in handling of \epsfbox without dimensions. 

  2007-08-21 21:54:57 (r619)

    Trying to track down a bug, I added a few more environments to
    getSection(). 

  2007-08-21 21:26:27 (r618)

    Support aux files that include other aux files using \@include
    suggested by mwtoews++. Not extensively tested, but the sample
    provided in the bugs tracker seems to work. 

  2007-08-21 20:56:43 (r617)

    A buggy attempt at implementing \geometry. I don't know why it
    doesn't work.

  2007-08-21 20:35:43 (r616)

    include a more comprehensive ifclause.tex test; commented out
    complicated examples for now, since they don't work. A tabular test
    was modified for a multicolumn bug.

  2007-08-21 20:02:29 (r615)

    add support for \underbar as suggested by jspitzm++ 

  2007-08-21 16:15:23 (r614)

    Added support for geometry margin family commands, including handling
    of option = {val1, val2} and option = {ratio1, ratio2}.

  2007-08-21 08:57:15 (r613)

    WH: added test file enc_utf8x.tex 

  2007-08-20 15:40:40 (r612)

    Add support for \iflatextortf, latextortftrue, latex2rtffalse
    properly ignore all \newif constructs add a simple test file
    ifclause.tex 

  2007-08-20 12:14:03 (r611)

    add simple test file for geometry package correct units in diagnostic
    string 

  2007-08-20 12:12:25 (r610)

    add new keyvalue routine to util.c, to aid in parsing option lists
    use in preamble.c to provide skeleton for geometry package 

  2007-08-20 11:49:44 (r609)

    WH: added test file enc_utf8x.tex 

  2007-08-20 00:58:18 (r608)

    change diagnostic level for UTF support 

  2007-08-20 00:57:20 (r607)

    minor changes to character counting for utf8 support 

  2007-08-18 21:46:20 (r606)

    Initial support for geometry package. Only supports default margins
    and the 'margin' option as the only option passed to the package.

  2007-08-17 15:22:05 (r605)

    WH: added test file enc_utf8x.tex 

  2007-08-17 14:50:14 (r604)

    WH: added support for [utf8x]{inputenc} + test file enc_utf8x.tex 

  2007-08-15 17:44:35 (r603)

    Add utf8 support. Only active if the file has
    \usepackage[utf8]{encoding} The support only takes utf8 characters
    from input and emits them as \u1234? sequences. This is untested. 

  2007-08-15 01:36:43 (r602)

    Rename CmdHacekChar to CmdCaronChar. Use the unicode combining
    character for caron and cedilla when all else fails. accentchars.rtf
    and overstrike.rtf look fine in Word 2004 for Mac. 

  2007-08-15 01:20:50 (r601)

    a couple of edits that missed the last check-in 

  2007-08-15 01:20:30 (r600)

    Move ldots to chars.c Update overstrike.tex, still needs to have some
    test cases added but generally much better. Multiple fixes to chars.c
    Raise accents on tall letters. Rename CmdOaccentChar to CmdRingChar
    overstrike.rtf displays completely correctly in Word. Converting some
    equations to equation editor objects fails. I think that this is the
    way things will stay. Added fixes to overstrike from Wilfried++

  2007-08-14 01:23:58 (r599)

    Makefile changed to use the -lm flag. I don't know if I did this
    correctly, but an explicit -lm flag is now necessary because the
    chars.c file includes math.h. I've never understood why gcc can't
    include math.h without this flag, but it doesn't, at least on Debian
    GNU/Linux. 
    
    Also added a newline at the end of funct1.h so that the associated
    compile warnings will stop bugging me.
    
    One actual feature fix - I removed the \- command from the rtf
    output, since rtf doesn't seem to include these hyphenation
    suggestions. They should not be visible in words that are not broken
    across two lines.

  2007-08-13 20:38:37 (r598)

    Remove unused routines. Minor whitespace tweaks. 

  2007-08-13 20:06:20 (r597)

    Fixed the \d{o} so that it works the way everything else does. There
    were some completely wrong unicode values in CmdUnderdotChar(). Not
    sure how they got there or if they ever worked. 

  2007-08-13 16:27:35 (r596)

    update ring characters, cedilla chars, caron chars. Underdot chars
    seem broken. Still need work. 

  2007-08-13 03:00:23 (r595)

    delete incorrect comments and remove unused code 

  2007-08-13 02:59:18 (r594)

    Fixes for the breve accent 

  2007-08-13 02:22:31 (r593)

    More tweaks for umlautes/ddot and grave accents 

  2007-08-13 00:48:52 (r592)

    Bring the doubleacute accent characters up to date 

  2007-08-13 00:37:42 (r591)

    Work on the accute accent characters. This turned out to be harder
    than expected because nothing seems to work when converting to
    equation editor objects in word. Oh well. 

  2007-08-11 18:52:22 (r590)

    More unicode clean up. Rename put_unicode_char to putUnicodeChar() to
    match the silly conventions that latex2rtf uses. Add a parameter so
    that the default character makes sense. 

  2007-08-11 04:28:52 (r589)

    Clean up handling of tilde chars. Allow \hat and \dot to work on
    something other than characters if necessar e.g., \.{\alpha}. 

  2007-08-10 22:57:42 (r588)

    Test file for overstrike characters e.g. \hat{a} 

  2007-08-10 22:55:36 (r587)

    Fixes for hatted characters. More clean-up and factoring of dotted
    chars as well. 

  2007-08-10 21:38:54 (r586)

    Fix dotted characters. Use unicode when possible except in equations.
    In equations or when no unicode character exists, then use the
    overstrike field to provide the dot. These are not perfect, but the
    dots are present *and* the results when converted to equation editor
    objects are not horrible! 

  2007-08-10 01:27:55 (r585)

    Apply unicode patches. I think that it is probably much better to
    emit a unicode sequence for a real character like \.{A}, than to rely
    on the more-or-less broken technique of using Word fields to stack
    two characters on top of one another. I think that I will need to go
    in an rip out g_unicode, since I cannot imagine a good reason to set
    g_unicode to zero. 

  2007-08-09 17:56:10 (r584)

    Revise caption in tabbing.tex as per Wilfried++. Fix bug reported in
    tabbing for extra \\. 

  2007-08-09 17:02:46 (r583)

    Add unicode number for ellipsis ... just in case 

  2007-08-09 16:49:07 (r582)

    Fixes for ldots and ellipsis. Nothing Microsoft does is consistent.
    Cannot use the ellipsis from the symbol font with impunity. Just use
    \'85, assuming standard windows encoding. But of course, use the
    symbol encoding in equations :) 

  2007-08-08 21:04:42 (r581)

    Support MT Extra properly. Now equations that contain characters from
    the MT Extra font work properly. The MT Extra characters also show up
    properly when no equation is present.
    
    There are still problems with MT Extra characters with values above
    128, But these changes solve most of the problems with the MT Extra
    characters. 

  2007-08-08 00:49:35 (r580)

    Add new test that shows the problems with MT Extra 

  2007-08-07 16:14:20 (r579)

    Fix \copyright Start to undo the changes I made to direct.cfg that
    involve MT Extra. Unicode seems to fail badly in Word. F or example
    {\f7\u8826\'70} just does not work in Word, but {\f7\'70} does. There
    are a bunch more entries in direct.cfg that need to be fixed. Make
    some changes for \sum when used without fields Change oddchars.tex to
    use \Sigma and \Pi instead of \sum and \prod 

  2007-08-07 07:55:10 (r578)

    WH: some updates to the documentation 

  2007-08-07 03:40:14 (r577)

    Now we don't emit the unicode sequence for characters in the symbol
    font when it is used outside fields. This only applies to commands
    that use direct.cfg 

  2007-08-06 19:39:16 (r576)

    rename putRtfChar to putRtfCharEscaped to be more descriptive
    Eliminate unnecessary usage of putRtfChar() Structure output so that
    EVERTHING goes through fprintRTF() and then through
    WriteEightBitChar() 

  2007-08-06 18:00:58 (r575)

    Initial pass on making all output go through one routine 

  2007-08-06 00:16:09 (r574)

    I touched a lot of stuff trying to figure out how to get symbols
    working in MS equation fields. I found a solution that works for
    Microsoft, but it breaks everything else. Basically I changed
    direct.cfg so that it will emit something like {\f6\u-3910\'ab} when
    a rightarrow is needed. This is great, but the unicode value is bogus
    and breaks all other rtf readers. 
    
    The right thing to do would be to emit {\f6\'ab} when not in a word
    equation field and {\f6\u-3910\'ab} when in one. I added such a
    routine in CmdMathChar() but did not want to do all the spade work to
    move *all* the entries that use the symbol font from direct.cfg. 
    
    I think the best solution would be an even lower level routine
    putSymbolChar() that would do the right thing. This would still
    require moving the entries from the direct.cfg file. putSymbolChar()
    would look like emit_math_char().

  2007-07-30 15:48:01 (r573)

    A bunch of small changes. Linked \dotfill to \ldots, which is
    probably the closest that rtf will get to true \dotfill.

    Another patch from Juergen, this one fixes citet with multiple years.
    Limited testing shows it works as expected. 

  2007-07-30 03:34:45 (r570)

    Infrastructure needed to support \Citet, \CiteP, and friends. 

  2007-07-29 04:25:34 (r568)

    Fixed an apparent bug in preamble.c, which selected
    set_longnamesfirst as default for natbib. As written now
    set_longnamesfirst must be selected explicitly. First commit, so it's
    about as small as possible.
