 Slight change in how HAS_NO_STRDUP is handled
	
2001-10-24 22:48  prahl

 Updated Texconv URL
	Revised another couple of chapters.  Only the last two remain!
	
2001-10-24 12:38  prahl

 Changes to l2r.html in this checkin and the last are a mistake.
	However latex2rtf passes pretty cleanly through both makeindex
	and through texi2dvi --pdf.  There is still quite a bit of clean-up
	needed in the chapters on configuration, errors, and development.
	I just added the sections on installation, and these could use some
	review as well.
	
2001-10-24 07:30  prahl

 Changes to make latex2rtf pass cleanly through makeinfo.  It still
	fails to pass through pdftex
	
2001-10-23 23:34  prahl

 Yet more changes to try and beat latex2rtf.texi into shape
	Still needs quite a bit of work and updating. A couple of node
	bugs still remain.

2001-10-23 07:35  prahl

 Added command line switches -v -h -Z
	renamed language switch from -i lang to -l lang
	previous encoding switch -l is now -C codepage
	renamed debugging switch from -v# to -d# to minimize initial confusion
	the switch -h prints an improved help message
	the switch -Z suppresses extra }'s at end of rtf file that are added
	just to make sure that improper latex2rtf parsing still creates a file
	that is readable by Word
	
2001-10-22 21:24  prahl

 Added new option to command line to specify the input encoding.  Use
	latex2rtf -C cp850 text

 Added support for \left and \right which unfortunately does not properly
	handle \left. or \right.
	Changed italicization of formula from always italic with ocassional
	forays into roman, to default to roman and italicize letters.
	Added support for \prime in direct.cfg and removed entries for \left
	and \right from that file.
	Check out tests in eqns.tex to see how this stuff works.
	
2001-10-16 21:43  prahl

 Much better support for \begin{array} ... \end{array}
	
2001-10-16 19:50  prahl

 Eliminated error() function.  Use diagnostics(ERROR, ) instead.
	
2001-10-16 19:48  prahl

 Starting cross referencing implementation.  This begins the process by
	renaming biblio.c to xref.c and moving all cross referencing code to
	xref.c.  I also moved declarations for a couple of variables from main.c
	to table.c
	
2001-10-14 20:43  prahl

	Rewired \ref so that it looks in the aux file for a number
	This needs more work also
	Modified the way that getParam works, does not *seem* to have busted
	anything.
	
2001-10-10 21:27  prahl

 added \Upsilon \varepsilon \varrho \L and \l to direct.cfg
	(only the first has a real translation).  I decided that the epsilon
	in the Symbol font was just like \varepsilon and so now \varepsilon
	maps to the epsilon in the Symbol font and \epsilon -> [epsilon]
	added encoding_tables.h to the Makefile
	moved \hoffset and friends to the preamble commands
	fixed a factor of two bug in getDimension

 Fixed bug with leading spaces in \documentclass[option1, option2]
	
2001-10-06 22:42  prahl

 Support for different input encodings.  Much more work needed, but
	this provides basic support for all input encodings available for latex2e.
	
2001-09-26 07:02  prahl

 Patch by Chris Lawrence to fix off-by-one error in cfg.c
	This fixes bug when LIBDIR does not end with a '/'
	
2001-09-25 22:34  prahl

	This is the last check-in before 1.9i tarball is released.
	
2001-09-25 20:31  prahl

 Rewrote paragraph handling completely.  Far fewer bugs in indentation
	of paragraphs.  Support for \indent and \noindent.  Infrastructure

	for bibliographies.  All test files now have matching opening and
	closing braces in the created RTF files.  Fixed bugs for \chapter.

 Fixed bug in IgnoreEnvironment
	Fixed bug in IgnoreParameter
	Added feature! insert \verbositylevel{5} in a LaTeX document and
	dynamically increase the verbosity of debugging output.  Of course
	the 5 can be replaced by any number from 0 to 6
	
2001-09-17 20:40  prahl

 Default alignment is once again justified
	Fixed bug with \mbox{}
	Fixed bug with \footnote{}
	Added support for german language
	Some support for french
	
2001-09-16 09:33  prahl

 Fixed bug in RTF output for papesize.
	Added support for b5paper, a5paper
	Enhanced support for all page sizes
	
2001-09-15 22:11  prahl

 Gave up and completely revised font handling.  latex2rtf now uses an output
	filter to keep track of the brace level and font changes in the RTF file.
	This allows \emph to be handled properly.  This will also allow digits to
	be typeset upright in math mode, but this has not been implemented yet.
	
2001-09-09 22:40  prahl

 Eliminated many mysterious spaces that crept into the RTF file
	Added braces to localize the effects of environments
	There are still problems with identifying the current font when
	environments are closed.   This is probably insoluble give the
	current constraints on the problem.
	Added align.tex to test the center, flushright, and flushleft environments
	
2001-09-09 20:14  prahl

 Fixed \sffamily and others
	Forced \plain in verb environments
	Eliminated extra document environment

	Problems still remain with test files misc3 and misc4
	
2001-08-23 07:26  prahl

 Just cleaning up the header for funct2.c.
	
2001-08-22 22:35  prahl

 Yet more changes to font handling.  Added \upshape \textup and \begin{upshape}
	Added \begin{Verbatim} as well as \Frac.  Tried to add \prod and \sum,
	but these don't yet work.  Seems that there are problems with processing
	frac.tex.  These will be worked on.
	
2001-08-21 22:50  prahl

 More improvements in handling of font family, shape, series, and size.
	LaTeX2RTF infrastructure now mimicks the LaTeX view of fonts.  This
	check-in fixes problems with fonts.tex and fontsize.tex.  It also adds
	support for \em, \emph, and \begin{em}...\end{em}.  Support for the
	relatively unusual \begin{itshape}...\end{itshape} and others is also
	included.
	
	Problems remain with misc3.tex and misc4.tex
	
2001-08-19 18:12  prahl

 Fixed subtle bug in ConvertString().  This was the real cause of the last
	problem with fonts.tex.  Basically, ConvertString() called Convert() only
	once, however if the string contained any open/close brace pairs e.g.,
	'the {\it italic} string' then everything after the closing brace would
	be discarded.
	
	I also fixed a problem with discarding the first space sent to Convert().
	
	The fix to ConvertString() and the initial space conversion require some
	careful testing.
	
2001-08-19 17:02  prahl

 Fixed problem with processing fonts.tex
	Added support for a variety French abbreviations
	
2001-08-12 16:39  prahl

 Revised fonts.cfg, removed Ferdsch, now set the default font correctly
	and begun the process of eliminating the $Log: ChangeLog,v $
	and begun the process of eliminating the Revision 1.17  2002/11/07 02:06:56  prahl
	and begun the process of eliminating the Support for processing figures using latex and including the result as a
	and begun the process of eliminating the png in the RTF file.  This is the new (undocumented) option -F.  This
	and begun the process of eliminating the check-in also adds support for processing \begin{music}...\end{music}
	and begun the process of eliminating the in the same way.  I also see that some of the partially enhanced latex2png
	and begun the process of eliminating the files have also made their way into this check-in as well.
	and begun the process of eliminating the comments in files.
	
2001-08-12 14:15  prahl

         Removed last two // comments
	        Explicitly cast char to int in isalpha() and isdigit()

	        Revised getLinenumber ... this is not perfect
	        Fixed bug in getTexChar() routine
	        Clearly separate preamble from the document in hopes that
	          one day more appropriate values for page size, margins,
	          paragraph spacing etc, will be used in the RTF header
	        I have added initial support for page sizes still needs testing
	        added two more test files misc3.tex and misc4.tex
	        misc4.tex produces a bad rtf file currently

2001-08-12 12:00  prahl

 1.9e
	        Revised all the accented character code using ideas borrowed from ltx2rtf.
	        Comparing ltx2rtf and latex2rtf indicates that Taupin and Lehner tended to work on
	        different areas of the latex->rtf conversion process.  Adding
	        accented characters is the first step in the merging process.
	
	        Added MacRoman font handling (primarily to get the breve accent)
	        Now supports a wide variety of accented characters.
	        (compound characters only work under more recent versions of word)
	        Reworked the code to change font sizes.
	        Added latex logo code from ltx2rtf
	        Extracted character code into separate file chars.c

	        hyperref not tested since I don't use it.
	        A small hyperref test file would be nice
	        Revised treatment of \oe and \OE per Wilfried Hennings suggestions
	        Added support for MT Extra in direct.cfg and fonts.cfg so that
	        more math characters will be translated e.g., \ell (see oddchars.tex)
	        added and improved font changing commands e.g., \texttt, \it
	
2001-08-12 11:41  prahl
