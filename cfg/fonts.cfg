#
# This file defines how LaTeX fonts are translated to fonts in the RTF file.
# Each line consists of a LaTeX font name, a comma, the RTF font name, and a period.
#
# Text after a sharp (#) is ignored to the end of the line.
# For repeated LaTeX font names, only the first is used.
# Any font in the LaTeX file not mentioned is mapped to the default font.
# All RTF fonts listed in this file will be in every RTF file header whether used or not.
# No spaces before or after the comma are allowed
#
# Dummy and Dummy2 have been added to improve translation of symbols. 
# These should not be deleted.  Additional symbol fonts can be added
# by defining e.g., Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.  Dummy3 can then be used
# in direct.cfg to handle other symbols.
#
# The default LaTeX fonts are 
#    Roman (\rm)
#    Slanted (\sl)
#    Sans Serif (\sf)
#    Typewriter (\tt)
#
# New shorter font list enabled by use of Unicode.  Abandoned Adobe font
# names in deference to the more complete variants listed.
