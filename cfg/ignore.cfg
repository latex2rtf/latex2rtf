# Variable Definition File
# This file is used for recognizing of LaTeX-variables and user defines ones.
# All variables are ignored but the converter must know them to do this
# correct
# write the variable-name command with slash, followed by comma
# then write the type of the variable followed by "." .
# Possible Types are:
# NUMBER : simple numeric value
# MEASURE : numeric value with following unit of measure
# OTHER: ignores anything to the first character after '='
#	 and from there to next space. eg. \setbox\bak=\hbox
# COMMAND: ignores anything to next '\' and from there to occurence
#	   of anything but a letter. eg. \newbox\bak
# SINGLE: ignore single command. eg. \noindent
# Please write the type uppercase exactly as above.
# Use no spaces !
# After this "#" character everything is ignored till end of line
