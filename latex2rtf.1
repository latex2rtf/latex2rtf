.SH NAME
latex2rtf \- Converts LaTeX file to RTF text-format
.SH SYNTAX
latex2rtf [-V] [-l] [ -o
.I outputfile
] [ -a
.I auxfile
] [ -b
.I bblfile
] [
.I inputfile
]
.PP
.SH WARNING
This man page is not supported by me (the maintainer of the programm).
For complete, current documentation, refer to the Info file
.B latex2rtf.info,
the PDF file
.B latex2rtf.pdf
or the HTML file
.B l2r.html
which are made from the Texinfo source file
.BR latex2rtf.texi.
.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I latex2rtf
command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format. The text and much
of the formatting 
information is translated to RTF making the new file look very similar to the
original. 
.PP
The \-V option prints version information on standard output and exits.
.PP
The -l option enables you to convert ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) special characters in the LaTeX source. 
.PP
Unless an 
.I outputfile
is specified with the -o option, the resulting RTF is produced on standard output.
.PP
You can specify an 
.I auxfile 
(for citations) with the -a option. If this is omitted, the
.I inputfile
with the suffix .aux will be taken.
.PP
You can specify an 
.I bblfile 
(for citations) with the -b option. If this is omitted, the
.I inputfile
with the suffix .bbl will be taken.
.PP
If 
.I inputfile
is not specified, standard input is read. 
.PP
User defined LaTeX commands are ignored. If you are familiar with the
RTF format and
the commands can be translated by simply inserting a format string
into the RTF
file you can add these commands to the 
.B direct.cfg
configuration file.
See format description below.
.PP
To correctly convert font names you must edit the 
.B fonts.cfg
configuration file.
You have to specify the font names you use and how the LaTeX default font names
should be converted to RTF. See format description below.
.PP
LaTeX variables and user defined commands are not evaluated.
They will be simply ignored. To let
.I latex2rtf
know the names of variables you can add them in the 
.B ignore.cfg
file.
See format description below.
.PP
The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the
support files (all files ending in .cfg). If no file is found during the
search in the search-path or if the environment variable is not set, the
compiled-in default for the configuration-file directory is used. If the
files are not found at all the program aborts.
.PP
\\label, \\ref, and \\pageref commands from LaTeX are translated to
hidden text in the RTF file. This makes it possible to correctly edit
the resulting file in the target word processor.
.SH CAUTION
Please make sure that the input file is a correct LaTeX file. Use LaTeX
to find and correct errors before using
.I latex2rtf.
The conversion command does not properly handle all
errors because of corrupt input files.
.PP
Make sure that the configuration files 
.B direct.cfg
and
.B fonts.cfg
are in the correct directory.
You may have to change
.B fonts.cfg
or
.B direct.cfg
to suit your needs.
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
The file
.B direct.cfg
is used for converting LaTeX commands by simple text replacement.
The format consists of lines with a LaTeX command with backslash
followed by comma.
The rest of the line until a '.' character will be written to the RTF file
when the command is recognized in the LaTeX file.
Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.
After the '.' everything is ignored to end of line.
To select a specific font use 
.I *fontname*.
Make sure that the font name 
.I fontname
is listed in the fonts configuration file at least as dummy.
To write the '*' character use "**".
example:
.PP
\\alpha,{\\f*Symbol* a}. #alpha under Windows Symbol Font
.PP
\\copyright,{\\ansi\\'a9\\pc}.
.PP
The file
.B fonts.cfg
contains the fonts conversion table.
A line consists of a font name in LaTeX followed by comma and a font
name in RTF. The end is marked by a '.'.
No spaces are allowed.
The LaTeX font will be converted to the RTF font if encountered in the
LaTeX file.
If multiple translations for a LateX font are specified,
only the first is used.
All fonts in a LaTeX file that are not in this file will be mapped to the
default font.
All RTF fonts listed in this file will be in every RTF file header whether
used or not.
Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.
After the '.' everything is ignored to end of line.
To add a RTF font not used as substitute for a LaTeX font \- for example
a Symbol font used in 
.B direct.cfg
\- use a dummy LaTeX name like in the following example:
.PP
Dummy3,MathematicalSymbols.
.PP
Make sure you use the correct font name. Take care of spaces in font names.
The default fonts are named Roman (command \\rm), Slanted (command \\sl),
Sans Serif (command \\sf), Typewriter (command \\tt).
.PP
The file
.B ignore.cfg
is used for defining how to ignore certain commands.
This file is used for recognition of LaTeX-variables, user defined variables,
and some simple commands.
All variables are ignored but the converter must know the names to correctly
ignore assignments to variables.
Lines in this file consist of a variable-name with backslash, followed
by comma and the type of the variable followed by '.'.
Possible Types are:
.PP
.TP
.B NUMBER
simple numeric value
.TP
.B MEASURE
numeric value with following unit of measure
.TP
.B OTHER
ignores anything to the first character after '=' and from there to next
space. eg. \\setbox\\bak=\\hbox
.TP
.B COMMAND
ignores anything to next '\\' and from there to occurence of anything
but a letter. eg. \\newbox\\bak
.TP
.B SINGLE
ignore single command. eg. \\noindent
.PP
The types are in upper case exactly as above.
Do not use spaces.
Lines starting with a '#' character are ignored.
After the '.' everything is ignored to end of line.
Example:
.PP
\\pagelength,MEASURE.
.PP
.SH BUGS
Some environments like figure are currently ignored. It would be nice to scan
the included information and convert things if possible.
.PP
Because the seek-command is used on input there are only file-redirections 
possible when reading from stdin. 
.PP
Some of the generated table can confuse Word, the problem may be corrected 
by editing the offending table within Word.
.PP
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Report bugs to glehner@unanleon.edu.ni (Georg Lehner). Please give the
following information and observe the following guidelines when
reporting a bug in the program:
.PP
Tell me the version of the program. For the executable you get the version by
specifying the \-V option to 
.I latex2rtf.
For the sources the version is
the version number of the file
.B version.h.
.PP
The Operating System and version number where you are running or
trying to install
.I latex2rtf.
Be sure to check the file 
.B Makefile
for settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some
versions of
.B SunOS
there may be settings which are needed to compile
successfully. Do this
.I before
writing to me.
.PP 
For problems with the DOS version, report installation problems to the
mainainer of the DOS port, Vladimir Menkov, vmenkov@cs.indiana.edu
.PP
If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include
a 
.I short
latex file along with a description of the problem.
.I Do not
send me large latex or rtf files, I simply do not have the time to
wade through large files to search for a bug! If necessary (i.e., the
program produces wrong or invalid rtf), send the rtf file that is
produced along with the latex input file.
.PP
Be patient with me. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I
did not write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to answer
to your question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in
upcoming releases.
