.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I latex2rtf
command converts a LaTeX file into RTF text format. The text and much of the formatting
information is translated to RTF making the new file look similar to the original.
.TP
.B \-a auxfile
Used to specify a particular cross-referencing file.
When this option is omitted, the 
.I auxfile 
is assumed to be the same as 
.I inputfile
with the .tex suffix replaced by .aux.
.TP
.B \-b bblfile
Used to specify a particular bibliography file 
When this option is omitted, the
.I bblfile 
is assumed to be the same as 
.I inputfile
with the .tex suffix replaced by .bbl.
.TP 
.B \-C codepage
used to specify the character set (code page) used in the LaTeX
document for non-ansi characters. 
.I codepage
may be one of the following:
ansinew, applemac, cp437, cp437de, cp850, cp852, cp865, decmulti,
cp1250, cp1252, latin1, latin2, latin3, latin4, latin5, latin9,
and next.  The default behavior is to use ansinew (same as cp1252).
.TP 
.B \-d#
Write extra debugging output to stderr.  Higher numbers cause more debugging output
and range from 0 (only errors) to 6 (absurdly many messages). The default is
1 (Warnings and Errors only).
.TP 
.B \-h
Print a short usage note
.TP 
.B \-i language
used to set the idiom or language used in the LaTeX document
.I language
may be one of the following
afrikaans, german, nynorsk, spanish, bahasa, dutch, icelandic, polish,
swedish, basque, english, portuges, turkish, brazil, esperanto, irish,
romanian, usorbian, breton, estonian, italian, samin, welsh, catalan,
finnish, latin, scottish, croatian, lsorbian, serbian, czech, french,
magyar, slovak, danish, galician, norsk, slovene.  The default is english.
.TP 
.B \-l
Assume latex source uses ISO 8859-1 (Latin-1) special characters (default behavior). 
.TP 
.B \-o outputfile
Redirect output to
.I outputfile
Unless an 
.I outputfile
is specified with the -o option, the resulting RTF is produced on a file with .tex
replaced by .rtf.
.TP 
.B \-V
Prints version information on standard output and exits.
.TP 
.B \-W 
Emit warnings directly in RTF file.  Handy for catching things that do not 
get translated correctly.
.TP 
.B \-Z# 
Add # close braces to end of RTF file.  (Handy when file is not converted
correctly and will not open in another word processor.)
.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
The environment variable RTFPATH may contain a search path for the
support files (all files ending in .cfg). If no file is found during the
search in the search-path or if the environment variable is not set, the
compiled-in default for the configuration-file directory is used. If the
files are not found at all the program aborts.

To correctly convert font names you must edit the 
.B fonts.cfg
configuration file.
You have to specify the font names you use and how the LaTeX default font names
should be converted to RTF. See format description below.
.PP
LaTeX variables and user defined commands are not evaluated.
They will be simply ignored. To let
.I latex2rtf
know the names of variables you can add them in the 
.B ignore.cfg
file.
See format description below.
.PP
.SH CAUTION
Please make sure that the input file is a correct LaTeX file. Use LaTeX
to find and correct errors before using
.I latex2rtf.
The conversion command does not properly handle all
errors because of corrupt input files.
.PP
Make sure that the configuration files 
.B direct.cfg
and
.B fonts.cfg
are in the correct directory.
You may have to change
.B fonts.cfg
or
.B direct.cfg
to suit your needs.
.SH BUGS
Some environments like figure are currently ignored. It would be nice to scan
the included information and convert things if possible.
.PP
Because the seek-command is used on input there are only file-redirections 
possible when reading from stdin. 
.PP
Some of the generated table can confuse Word, the problem may be corrected 
by editing the offending table within Word.
.PP
.SH REPORTING BUGS
Report bugs to glehner@unanleon.edu.ni (Georg Lehner). Please give the
following information and observe the following guidelines when
reporting a bug in the program:
.PP
Tell me the version of the program. For the executable you get the version by
specifying the \-V option to 
.I latex2rtf.
For the sources the version is
the version number of the file
.B version.h.
.PP
The Operating System and version number where you are running or
trying to install
.I latex2rtf.
Be sure to check the file 
.B Makefile
for settings that may be specific to your machine, especially for some
versions of
.B SunOS
there may be settings which are needed to compile
successfully. Do this
.I before
writing to me.
.PP
If the program produces wrong output or does not work for you, include
a 
.I short
latex file along with a description of the problem.
.I Do not
send me large latex or rtf files, I simply do not have the time to
wade through large files to search for a bug! If necessary (i.e., the
program produces wrong or invalid rtf), send the rtf file that is
produced along with the latex input file.
.PP
Be patient with me. I am maintaining the program in my free time. I
did not write most of the code. Often I do not have the time to answer
to your question. I will, however, try to fix reported bugs in
upcoming releases.
